Hi all, 
can anybody explain me the turning of page table (i386) when the kernel is loaded. 
I have gone through 
http://home.earthlink.net/~jknapka/linux-mm/vminit.html 
but not able to understand very well that 
how that it maps to physical memory using swapper_pg_dir and What is funda behind the 
mapping memory 0 to 8MB 
Thanks in advance 
praveen
