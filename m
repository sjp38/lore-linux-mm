Hello all,

I installed redhat 7.1 on a box ( pentiumI 166MHz,73Mb
of rams and 1.5 Gb hard disk)  that was previously
used by win98. I heard that linux is faster than
windows. Am running kde now with a 250Mb swap
partition but it is extremely slow, far slower than
when I was using windows on it. Can someone tell me
what to do please?
