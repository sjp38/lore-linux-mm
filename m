Hi,

In the primary version of my DMA allocation patch, I tried to allocate
pages with GFP_DMA as much as possible, then allocate with GFP_KERNEL
as fallback.  But this doesn't work.  When the zone DMA is exhausted,
I oberseved endless OOM-killer.

Is this a desired behavior?  I don't think triggering OOM-killer for
zone DMA makes sense, because apps don't allocate pages in this
area...

Note that the driver tried to allocate bunch of single pages with
GFP_DMA, not big pages, by calling dma_alloc_coherent with GFP_DMA
only (no __GFP_REPEAT or such modifiers).
