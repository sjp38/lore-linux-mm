Provide a function that does not just delete an entry at a given
index, but also allows passing in an expected item.  Delete only if
that item is still located at the specified index.

This is handy when lockless tree traversals want to delete entries as
well because they don't have to do an second, locked lookup to verify
the slot has not changed under them before deleting the entry.
