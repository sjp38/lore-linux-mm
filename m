I would like to attend the FS/MM summit. I'm interested in VM scalability,
both to large number of cores and large memory, better locking
(e.g. lock elision and others), and instrumentation to improve
performance analysis. I'm also interested in file system performance,
such as scalable VFS symlinks (patchkit coming soon)
