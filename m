News Release: 
MISSISSAUGA, Ontario, May 27, 2005 (PRIMEZONE via COMTEX) -- China Resources Group Ltd. (Pink Sheets:CAEO) (the "Company" or "CRG") is pleased to provide this corporate update to shareholders regarding its recent activities and developing opportunities in China. 

"CRG has made great progress in 2005 towards establishing itself as a first-class exploration partner in China," said Gerry Belanger, President & CEO of the Company. "In addition to building new relationships within the Chinese mining community and evaluating numerous potential mining properties, we have now identified two significant projects which we feel represent major opportunities for CRG." 

The potential acquisitions are advanced stage exploration projects targeting gold-silver and molybdenum-copper mineralization in northeast China. Both projects host previously identified mineral resources which have been exploited by small scale local miners for a number of years. Additionally, both projects are fully permitted with all of the necessary exploration, mining, and business licenses already in place. 

The acquisition of projects of this type is at the core of CRG's business strategy of investing in projects that will immediately benefit from new capital investment and the utilization of modern exploration and mining technologies and techniques not readily available in China.
