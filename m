Hi,

I am struggling with meaningless values of Committed_AS on a number of
Linux systems that I manage or have access to. I do wonder if this is a bug
in the kernel (certain versions or configurations) or my lack of
understanding even after reading the limited amount of code that seems
to deal with the task of counting committed memory (wherever
vm_committed_as appears).

How can it be that the kernel shows a value for Committed_AS that is
_smaller_ than the currently used memory after disregarding
cache/buffers?

An extreme example is a CentOS 7 NFS server (400 clients) that has
MemTotal-MemAvailable of 7431272K, but only Committed_AS of 655532K.
This is less than a tenth!

How can the committed memory be smaller than the physically used memory?

Eeven if it is supposed to be an estimate, it should not be obviously
wrong (by an oder of magnitude), should it? I'd think that the kernel
does accurately keep track of the committed amount of memory. It for
sure looks so with the use of vm_acct_memory().

Am I missing some kernel configuration that intentionally triggers
these strangely low values for a reason? I looked at a range of systems
and found some with the same inverted relation with Committed_AS, some
with numbers that at least do not look obviously wrong. I also built a
vanilla 4.14.84 kernel loosely based on the CentOS config and booted a
compute node with it. I probably falsely remember that it also showed
the issue, but maybe I looked at the wrong system back then. Now this
node shows reasonable numbers (0.5G used, 1.8G committed), also on
fresh boot where a system with the stock kernel has too low committed
memory from the start.

For more context, please see

	https://serverfault.com/questions/942173/

where I included a list of differing systems with the relation of the
physical and virtual memory use.
