I cannot speak for the others, but I know I'll gladly help
you out when you don't know where to look for things.

The source will be the most important place to look for
information, but we'll be there to help you out if you
can't find the stuff or if the source is poorly documented.

I think it will be great to have our source reviewed by
someone who is writing documentation instead of trying
to add a hack to do this-or-that. It could cause a nice
cleanup of the comments and the code structure so I think
we should help Paul as much as possible...

cheers,
