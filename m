Hi all,

Does anyone know of any VM work that needs help? Without some direction 
and goals (ones that are actually helpful) I don't fell like I'm getting 
anywhere in learning/helping kernel development. I feel like I'm trying 
to learn how to ride a bike by merely reading about it :(

Thoughts?

Thanks!
Kirk
