Hi,

I have constructed the memory-management developers' homepage
where:
- you can get a link to your mm-related homepage with patches
- with an informative description of all _mm_ patches on your page
- if you don't have a homepage, you can just send the patch +
  description to me and I'll put them in the unsorted-patches
  section...

In short: this is the place where memory-management patches go,
so people like Jim Pick won't have to deal with them...

Currently this page contains 3 developers' pages (including
my own :), so I also ask for submissions from all memory-
management hackers...

A special mm-wishlist would also be nice... (would it??)

you can get at my page via http://www.fys.ruu.nl/~riel
and (RSN) via Linux-HQ.

Rik.
