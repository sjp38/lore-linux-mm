<p>TwistedHumor.com Joke of the day July 20, 1999</p>
<p>Viagra Date </p>
<p>A guy walks into a pharmacy and says to the pharmacist, "Listen, I have three 
  girls coming over tonight. I've never had three girls at once. I need something 
  to keep me horny.. keep me potent." </p>
<p>The pharmacist reaches under the counter, unlocks the bottom drawer and takes 
  out a small cardboard box marked with a label "Viagra Extra Strength" and says, 
  "Here, if you eat this, you'll go nuts for twelve hours." </p>
<p>The guy says, "Gimme three boxes." </p>
<p>The next day the guy walks into the same pharmacy, limps up to the pharmacist 
  and pulls down his pants. The pharmacist looks in horror as he notices the man's 
  penis is black and blue, and skin is hanging off in some places. </p>
<p>In a pained voice, the man moans out, "Gimme a bottle of Deep Heat." </p>
<p>The pharmacist replies in horror, "You can't put Deep Heat on that!" </p>
<p>The man replies, "No, it's for my arms, the girls didn't show up." </p>

<p>------------------------------------------------------------- </p>

A hip young man bought a 1999 Ferrari GTO.  It's the fastest and most
expensive car in the world, and it costs him $500,000.  He takes it 
out for a spin and stops for a red light.  An old man on a moped pulls 
up next to him.  The old man looks over at the sleek, shiny car and 
asks, "What kind of car ya' got there, sonny?"   The young man 
replies, "A 1999 Ferrari GTO.  It cost half a million dollars!"  
"That's a lot of money, "says the old man. "Why does it cost so much?"
 "Because this car can do 320 miles an hour" states the young man 
proudly.   The old man asks, "Mind if I take a look inside?"   
"No problem," replies the owner.   So the old man pokes his head 
in the window and looks around.  Then sitting back on his moped, 
the old man says, "That's a pretty nice car, all right!"   Just then 
the light changes and the guy decides to show the old man just what 
his car can do.  He floors it, and within 30 seconds the speedometer 
reads 160 mph.  Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear view mirror.  
It seems to be getting closer!  He slows down just slightly to see 
what it could be and within half a second, whhhoooossshhh!  it whips by him, 
going much, much faster!   "What on earth could be going faster than my 
Ferrari," the young man asks himself in shock.   Then, ahead of him, he 
sees a dot coming toward him at an ungodly amount of speed! 
Whoooooosh! It goes by again, heading the opposite 
direction and it looked like the old man on the moped!   "Couldn't 
be," thinks the guy.  "How could a moped outrun a Ferrari?"  But again, 
he sees a dot in his rear view mirror! Whooooosh, Ka-BbblaMMM!  It plows 
into the back of his car, demolishing the rear end.  The young man jumps 
out, and it IS the old man!  He runs up to the mangled  old man and says, 
"Oh my goodness! Is there anything I can do for you?"  The old man 
whispers with his dying breath, "Unhook...my suspenders from your 
side-view mirror..."
