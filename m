Claims, subject to:

(i) the completion by the Company of confirmation of legal title and due diligence on the Properties as to ownership by the Vendor and results therefrom being satisfactory to the

(iii) The Vendor and the Company shall put forth, all their reasonable best efforts to obtain a satisfactory title opinion or Court Order, or such that the Company will acquire the property freee and clear of all liens and encumbrances, with a view to further develop the property into an operating mine.
