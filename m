Hi all,

Dave, Eric, and I have been chasing a stale data exposure bug in the XFS
reflink implementation, and tracked it down to reflink forgetting to do
some of the file-extending activities that must happen for regular
writes.

We then started auditing the clone, dedupe, and copyfile code and
realized that from a file contents perspective, clonerange isn't any
different from a regular file write.  Unfortunately, we also noticed
that *unlike* a regular write, clonerange skips a ton of overflow
checks, such as validating the ranges against s_maxbytes, MAX_NON_LFS,
and RLIMIT_FSIZE.  We also observed that cloning into a file did not
strip security privileges (suid, capabilities) like a regular write
would.  I also noticed that xfs and ocfs2 need to dump the page cache
before remapping blocks, not after.

In fixing the range checking problems I also realized that both dedupe
and copyfile tell userspace how much of the requested operation was
acted upon.  Since the range validation can shorten a clone request (or
we can ENOSPC midway through), we might as well plumb the short
operation reporting back through the VFS indirection code to userspace.
I added a few more cleanups to the xfs code per reviewer suggestions.

So, here's the whole giant pile of patches[1] that fix all the problems.
This branch is against current upstream (4.19-rc8).  The patch
"generic: test reflink side effects" recently sent to fstests exercises
the fixes in this series.  Tests are in [2].
