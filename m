Hi,
there is one THP related track scheduled currently but we have more THP
topics which might be interesting IMO. Both Kirrill and Hugh have a very
related topic so theirs should definitely stay.

Vlastimil has covered current pain points of THPs in his RFC recently
(http://marc.info/?l=linux-mm&m=142469637313693&w=2). I think this
deserves a separate slot so that we can discuss issues mentioned in the
cover letter. There are still some slots free AFAICS.

What do you think?
