I have looked into this deeper. I think it would be very difficult to 
consolidate the whole logic into a single xas_for_each() loop because, 
we do disk io and might sleep. I have refactored the code such that it 
much more readable now and I am using the same format used by 
find_get_entries.

Will send out the next revision later today.


Thanks,

Vineeth
