Memory compaction works by having a "freeing scanner" scan from one end of a 
zone which isolates pages as migration targets while another "migrating scanner" 
scans from the other end of the same zone which isolates pages for migration.

When page migration fails for an isolated page, the target page is returned to 
the system rather than the freelist built by the freeing scanner.  This may 
require the freeing scanner to continue scanning memory after suitable migration 
targets have already been returned to the system needlessly.

This patch returns destination pages to the freeing scanner freelist when page 
migration fails.  This prevents unnecessary work done by the freeing scanner but 
also encourages memory to be as compacted as possible at the end of the zone.
