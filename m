I was thinking that such 'architectural' differences in core
idea (like system call handling, execution model, process
context design, etc) is better to have a different architecture
even if some part of the code is similar.

Isn't it also the same to the other 'hardware-dependent'
architectures' case like between arm and arm64 ?

of course I'm also happy to share the code between us,
especially _pure_ userspace part like (virtual) NIC with
tap or pcap because we also need that part, but we kept such
code at an external codebase (i.e., linux-libos-tools).

okay.

thanks.
