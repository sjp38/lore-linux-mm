Application may want to get aligned allocation for different reasons.
It should be okay for userspace to ask for size + (alignment - PAGE_SIZE)
and then round up the address to get the alignment. We basically do the
same on kernel side.

For THP, I believe, kernel already does The Right Thingâ„¢ for most users.
User still may want to get speific range as THP (to avoid false sharing or
something). But still I believe userspace has all required tools to get it
right.
