From: Mel Gorman <mel@csn.ul.ie>

rmap_walk_anon() was triggering errors in memory compaction that look like
use-after-free errors. The problem is that between the page being isolated
from the LRU and rcu_read_lock() being taken, the mapcount of the page
dropped to 0 and the anon_vma gets freed. This can happen during memory
compaction if pages being migrated belong to a process that exits before
migration completes. Hence, the use-after-free race looks like

 1. Page isolated for migration
 2. Process exits
 3. page_mapcount(page) drops to zero so anon_vma was no longer reliable
 4. unmap_and_move() takes the rcu_lock but the anon_vma is already garbage
 4. call try_to_unmap, looks up tha anon_vma and "locks" it but the lock
    is garbage.

This patch checks the mapcount after the rcu lock is taken. If the
mapcount is zero, the anon_vma is assumed to be freed and no further
action is taken.
