Subject: [PATCH] mm/page_alloc: Don't call kasan_free_pages() at deferred mem init

When CONFIG_KASAN is enabled on large memory SMP systems, the deferrred
pages initialization can take a long time. Below were the reported init
times on a 8-socket 96-core 4TB IvyBridge system.

  1) Non-debug kernel without CONFIG_KASAN
     [    8.764222] node 1 initialised, 132086516 pages in 7027ms

  2) Debug kernel with CONFIG_KASAN
     [  146.288115] node 1 initialised, 132075466 pages in 143052ms

So the page init time in a debug kernel was 20X of the non-debug kernel.
The long init time can be problematic as the page initialization is
done with interrupt disabled. In this particular case, it caused the
appearance of following warning messages as well as NMI backtraces
of all the cores that were doing the initialization.

The long init time was mainly caused by the call to kasan_free_pages() to
poison the newly initialized pages. On a 4TB system, we are talking about
almost 500GB of memory probably on the same node.

In reality, we may not need to poison the newly initialized pages before
they are ever allocated. So KASAN poisoning of freed pages before the
completion of deferred memory initialization is now disabled. Those
pages will be properly poisoned when they are allocated or freed after
deferred pages initialization is done.

With this change, the new page initialization time became:

[   21.948010] node 1 initialised, 132075466 pages in 18702ms

This was still about double the non-debug kernel time, but was much
better than before.
