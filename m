Hi Eric,

I ran these patches through a series of small tests and I have just one
concern with the changes made to can_do_hugetlb_shm(). If that returns false
because of MAP_HUGETLB, we then proceed to call user_shm_lock(). I think your
intention might have been something like the following patch on top of yours?

For what it's worth, once this was applied, I didn't spot any other
problems, run-time or otherwise.

=====
hugetlbfs: Do not call user_shm_lock() for MAP_HUGETLB

The patch
hugetlbfs-allow-the-creation-of-files-suitable-for-map_private-on-the-vfs-internal-mount.patch
alters can_do_hugetlb_shm() to check if a file is being created for shared
memory or mmap(). If this returns false, we then unconditionally call
user_shm_lock() triggering a warning. This block should never be entered
for MAP_HUGETLB. This patch partially reverts the problem and fixes the check.

This patch should be considered a fix to
hugetlbfs-allow-the-creation-of-files-suitable-for-map_private-on-the-vfs-internal-mount.patch.
