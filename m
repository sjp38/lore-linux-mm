From: Michal Hocko <mhocko@suse.cz>

mem_cgroup_css_online calls mem_cgroup_put if memcg_init_kmem
fails. This is not correct because only memcg_propagate_kmem takes an
additional reference while mem_cgroup_sockets_init is allowed to fail as
well (although no current implementation fails) but it doesn't take any
reference. This all suggests that it should be memcg_propagate_kmem that
should clean up after itself so this patch moves mem_cgroup_put over
there.

Unfortunately this is not that easy (as pointed out by Li Zefan) because
memcg_kmem_mark_dead marks the group dead (KMEM_ACCOUNTED_DEAD) if it
is marked active (KMEM_ACCOUNTED_ACTIVE) which is the case even if
memcg_propagate_kmem fails so the additional reference is dropped in
that case in kmem_cgroup_destroy which means that the reference would be
dropped two times.

The easiest way then would be to simply remove mem_cgrroup_put from
mem_cgroup_css_online and rely on kmem_cgroup_destroy doing the right
thing.
