Well, there is a lot of pointer comparison in the kernel which means
pointer difference. Take is_vmalloc_addr() for example, even if your
patchset does not cover (IIUC) vmalloc() at the moment, this function
may be called with slab addresses. Presumably they would all fail the
check with a non-0xff tag but it's something needs understood. If you
later add support for vmalloc(), this test would fail (as would the
rb tree search in find_vmap_area(). Kmemleak would probably break as
well as it makes heavy use of rb tree.

Basically you need to be very clear about kernel pointer usage (with an
associated tag or type) vs address range it refers to and in most cases
converted to an unsigned long. See the other discussion on sparse, it
could potentially be useful if we can detect the places where a pointer
is converted to ulong and maybe hide such conversion behind a macro with
the arm64 implementation also clearing the tag.
