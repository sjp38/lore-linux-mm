Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. The best thing to do is end most of
these silly advocacy wars, and neither 'side' retaliating is the best
way to do this. As a regular user of many of both systems, the constant
FUD from everyone and anyone is just pathetically annoying.

The more ammo that gets sent, the more the other side will just send
ammo back again. It's an endless cycle that will never end.
