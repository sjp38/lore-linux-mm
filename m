NASDAQ OTCBB: MSGL - Listed Medical Technology MRI 
Software Company MSGL ? Developers of a Revolutionary 
MRI upgrade software package (currently being implemented
in facilities across the U.S.) that produces images with
up to 10X more clarity and resolution than standard MRI
processing software at a fraction of the price.

MSGL?s ground-breading SLICES software manipulates raw 
data matrices obtained through the MRI scanning process. 
Through the use of advanced calculations (MicroSignal's 
EXACT method), SLICES is able to produce images that 
boast up to 10 times more clarity and resolutions than 
standard MRI processing software.

In addition to superior image quality, and because of
the method of processing, SLICES? is able to significantly
reduce patient scan time and the need for patient call
backs and rescanning. These factors also can contribute
to a reduction in film consumption of up to 40%.

At the end of 2002, there were approximately 10,500 MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging) systems installed worldwide.
While changes in medical reimbursement have slowed the
sale of new MRI machines, and the ever-increasing demand
for improved image quality and reduced patient scan time;
thus there has been a tremendous need for products that
can improve patient throughput and image quality. OTCBB:
MSGL has solved this problem with its low cost software
that upgrades existing installed MRI systems to the quality
of a new machine at a savings of approximately $1.4 million
per machine.

The total estimated market for this system is in excess
of $1.3B. NASDAQ OTCBB: MSGL is expected to capture 
approximately 40% of this market within 3 years, resulting
in revenues of approximately $500 million, with a Net
Margin of approximately 35%, or over $100 million in
earnings.

Other medical technology / software & system developers
such as Baxter Medical NYSE: BAX ? p/e of 20X; NASDAQ:
NMMD, p/e of 31.4, NASDAQ: NMDC, p/e of 20X; an average
of 24X current EPS, and 20X 1 yr forward expected earnings.

In comparison to these valuations, NASDAQ OTCBB: MSGL,
with its proven market for its product, sales on the books
for the current quarter and a successful product launch
already would be more fairly valued at 25X?to-30X forward
earnings or $2.00 ?to- $3.00 per share currently.
