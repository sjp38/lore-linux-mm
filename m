Hi,
The last version of this series has been posted here [1]. The timing wasn't
all that great so this is mostly a resubmit. I've added one additional patch
to fix another pfn walker noticed by Joonsoo (this is patch 11) and also
added a clarification for pfn_valid() and offline pages.

There is still a lot of work on top - namely this implementation doesn't
support reonlining to a different zone on the zones boundaries but I
will do that in a separate series because this one is getting quite
large already and it should work reasonably well now.

Joonsoo had some worries about pfn_valid and suggested to change its
semantic to return false on offline holes but I would be rally worried
to change a established semantic used by a lot of code and so I have
introuduced pfn_to_online_page helper instead. If this is seen as a
controversial point I would rather drop pfn_to_online_page and related
patches as they are not stictly necessary because the code would be
similarly broken as now wrt. offline holes.

This is a rebase on top of the current mmotm tree (mmotm-2017-05-12-15-53)
and the full series is in
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mhocko/mm.git try
attempts/rewrite-mem_hotplug branch.

Motivation:
Movable onlining is a real hack with many downsides - mainly
reintroduction of lowmem/highmem issues we used to have on 32b systems -
but it is the only way to make the memory hotremove more reliable which
is something that people are asking for.

The current semantic of memory movable onlinening is really cumbersome,
however. The main reason for this is that the udev driven approach is
basically unusable because udev races with the memory probing while only
the last memory block or the one adjacent to the existing zone_movable
are allowed to be onlined movable. In short the criterion for the
successful online_movable changes under udev's feet. A reliable udev
approach would require a 2 phase approach where the first successful
movable online would have to check all the previous blocks and online
them in descending order. This is hard to be considered sane.

This patchset aims at making the onlining semantic more usable. First of
all it allows to online memory movable as long as it doesn't clash with
the existing ZONE_NORMAL. That means that ZONE_NORMAL and ZONE_MOVABLE
cannot overlap. Currently I preserve the original ordering semantic so
the zone always precedes the movable zone but I have plans to remove this
restriction in future because it is not really necessary.

First 3 patches are cleanups which should be ready to be merged right
away (unless I have missed something subtle of course).

Patch 4 deals with ZONE_DEVICE dependencies down the __add_pages path.

Patch 5 deals with implicit assumptions of register_one_node on pgdat
initialization.

Patches 6-10 deal with offline holes in the zone for pfn walkers. I
hope I got all of them right but people familiar with compaction should
double check this.

Patch 11 is the core of the change. In order to make it easier to review
I have tried it to be as minimalistic as possible and the large code
removal is moved to patch 14.

Patch 12 is a trivial follow up cleanup. Patch 13 fixes sparse warnings
and finally patch 14 removes the unused code.

I have tested the patches in kvm:
# qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -monitor pty -m 2G,slots=4,maxmem=4G -numa node,mem=1G -numa node,mem=1G ...

and then probed the additional memory by
(qemu) object_add memory-backend-ram,id=mem1,size=1G
(qemu) device_add pc-dimm,id=dimm1,memdev=mem1

Then I have used this simple script to probe the memory block by hand
# cat probe_memblock.sh
#!/bin/sh

BLOCK_NR=$1

# echo $((0x100000000+$BLOCK_NR*(128<<20))) > /sys/devices/system/memory/probe

# for i in $(seq 10); do sh probe_memblock.sh $i; done
# grep . /sys/devices/system/memory/memory3?/valid_zones 2>/dev/null

The main difference to the original implementation is that all new
memblocks can be both online_kernel and online_movable initially
because there is no clash obviously. For the comparison the original
implementation would have

/sys/devices/system/memory/memory33/valid_zones:Normal

Block 33 can still be online both kernel and movable while all
the remaining can be only movable.
/proc/zonelist says

        high     149
        spanned  32768
        present  32768

A new memblock at a lower address will result in a new memblock (32)
which will still allow both Normal and Movable.
# sh probe_memblock.sh 0
# grep . /sys/devices/system/memory/memory3[2-5]/valid_zones 2>/dev/null
/sys/devices/system/memory/memory32/valid_zones:Normal Movable
/sys/devices/system/memory/memory33/valid_zones:Normal Movable
/sys/devices/system/memory/memory34/valid_zones:Movable
/sys/devices/system/memory/memory35/valid_zones:Movable

and online_kernel will convert it to the zone normal properly
while 33 can be still onlined both ways.
# echo online_kernel > /sys/devices/system/memory/memory32/state
# grep . /sys/devices/system/memory/memory3[2-5]/valid_zones 2>/dev/null
/sys/devices/system/memory/memory32/valid_zones:Normal

/sys/devices/system/memory/memory34/valid_zones:Movable
/sys/devices/system/memory/memory35/valid_zones:Movable

/proc/zoneinfo will now tell

  pages free     65441
        min      165
        low      230

        high     146
        spanned  32768
        present  32768

so both zones have one memblock spanned and present.

Onlining 39 should associate this block to the movable zone
# echo online > /sys/devices/system/memory/memory39/state

/proc/zoneinfo will now tell
Node 0, zone   Normal
  pages free     32765
        min      80
        low      112
        high     144
        spanned  32768
        present  32768

        high     290
        spanned  196608
        present  65536

so we will have a movable zone which spans 6 memblocks, 2 present and 4
representing a hole.

Offlining both movable blocks will lead to the zone with no present
pages which is the expected behavior I believe.
# echo offline > /sys/devices/system/memory/memory39/state
# echo offline > /sys/devices/system/memory/memory34/state
# grep -A6 "Movable\|Normal" /proc/zoneinfo

Any thoughts, complains, suggestions?

As a bonus we will get a nice cleanup in the memory hotplug codebase.
