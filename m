My patch should be okay for pages which are already hot when Hcold
passes,  but I found that the paper says pages which are turned hot by
Hcold should be placed at the list head, which requires a page flag to
implement.  I think the PG_test bit could be abused for this purpose.

The paper doesn't have cold to cold test page state transition,
although Song said otherwise in the mailing list.  I thought this
reinsert behavior is a part of the divergence.
