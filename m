The current thread mode semantics aren't sufficient to fully support
threaded controllers like cpu. The main problem is that when thread
mode is enabled at root (mainly for performance reason), all the
non-threaded controllers cannot be supported at all.

To alleviate this problem, the roles of thread root and threaded
cgroups are now further separated. Now thread mode can only be enabled
on a non-root leaf cgroup whose parent will then become the thread
root. All the descendants of a threaded cgroup will still need to be
threaded. All the non-threaded resource will be accounted for in the
thread root. Unlike the previous thread mode, however, a thread root
can have non-threaded children where system resources like memory
can be further split down the hierarchy.

Now we could have something like

	R -- A -- B
	 \
	  T1 -- T2

where R is the thread root, A and B are non-threaded cgroups, T1 and
T2 are threaded cgroups. The cgroups R, T1, T2 form a threaded subtree
where all the non-threaded resources are accounted for in R.  The no
internal process constraint does not apply in the threaded subtree.
Non-threaded controllers need to properly handle the competition
between internal processes and child cgroups at the thread root.

This model will be flexible enough to support the need of the threaded
controllers.
