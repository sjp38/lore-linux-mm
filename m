Hi,

I would like to attend LSF/MM this year to discuss about HMM
(Heterogeneous Memory Manager) and more generaly all topics
related to GPU and heterogeneous memory architecture (including
persistent memory).

I want to discuss how to move forward with HMM merging and i
hope that by MM summit time i will be able to share more
informations publicly on devices which rely on HMM.
