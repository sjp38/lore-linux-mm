The Desk of Dr.TONDE
 
 
Zenith Bank of Nigeria,
Lagos-Nigeria.
 
Dear Sir,

STRICTLY A PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL
 
I am Dr.TONDE, The manager, Bills and
Exchange at the Foreign Remittance Department of the Zenith
Bank of Nigeria Plc. I am writing this letter to ask for your
support and cooperation to carry out this business opportunity in 
my department.
We discovered an  abandoned sum of USD$50.3M(Fifty million three 
hundreds United States Dollars only) in an account that belongs to 
one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family 
of a wife and two children in November 1997 in a Plane crash.

Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting
his next-of-kin to come over and put claims for his money as the 
heir, because we cannot release the fund from his account unless 
someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to
the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.
Unfortunately, neither their family member nor
distant relative has everappeared to claim the said fund. Upon this
discovery, I and other officials in my department have agreed to 
make business with you and release the total amount into your 
account as the heir of the fund since no one came
for it or discovered he maintained account with our bank, otherwise 
the fund will be returned to the banks treasury as unclaimed fund.
We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as
stated thus;

20 % for you as foreign partner,
5 % for us the officials in my department and
5 % for the settlement of all local and foreign
expences incurred by us and you during the course of
this business.
Upon the successful completion of this transfer, I
and one of my colleagues will come to your country and
mind our share. It is from our 75 % we intend to import 
Agricultural Machineries into my country
as a way of recycling the fund. To commence this
transaction, we require you to immediately
indicate your interest by a return e-mail and
enclose your private contact telephone number, fax number full
name and address and your designated bank coordinates to enable us 
file letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary 
approvals before the transfer can be
made. 

Note also, this transaction must be kept STRICTLY
CONFIDENTIAL because of its nature.
 
I look forward to receiving your prompt response through me 
alternative e-mail address (dr_tonde@rediffmail.com).
 
Dr.TONDE
