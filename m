I understand your point.
but ptrace(2) based system call interception used by UML
makes it depend on the host OS (i.e., linux kernel), while
LibOS uses symbol hijacking with weak alias and LD_PRELOAD.

we're really thinking to run this library on other
POSIX-like hosts (e.g., osx) though it's not coming yet.

thanks, it's new information for me.
were there any trial on this idea ?
