Borasky's Corollary 1: If you *can* measure it and it *does* exist, the
cheapest solution may still be to buy more memory, more disks or a faster
processor.

Borasky's Corollary 2: When you try to measure the performance of people the
way you measure performance of computers, you need psychological help.

Time for a corollary to "if you can't measure it, it doesn't exist":

"If you can't measure desktop performance, our method of development
 will ensure it won't exist"
