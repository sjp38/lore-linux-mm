Sorry for late reply.

We do.
Basically we need this kind of feature for almost all our latency
sensitive applications to avoid latency issue in memory allocation.

Currently we run those applications on custom kernels which this
kind of patch is applied to. But it is hard for us to support every
kernel version for it. Also there are several customers who can't
accept a custom kernel and so they must use other commercial Unix.
If this feature is accepted, they will definitely use it on their
systems.

Thanks,
