No, we do not trigger the memory reclaim path nor the oom killer when
using GFP_NOWAIT. In fact the current implementation even ignores
__GFP_NOFAIL AFAICS (so I was wrong about the endless loop but I suspect
that we used to loop fpr __GFP_NOFAIL at some point in the past). The
patch simply doesn't have any effect. But the primary objection is that
the behavior might change in future and you certainly do not want to get
stuck in the boot process without knowing what is going on. Crashing
will tell you that quite obviously. Although I have hard time imagine
how that could happen in a reasonably configured system.

How does it differ from blowing up right there when dereferencing flags?
It would be clear from the oops.
