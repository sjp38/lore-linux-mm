Dear Sir/Madam:

I am a student of Wayne State university. I take the course of "advanced 
operating system" this semester. In order to finish my assignment, I need 
to know the source code of "shmget, shmat, shmdt, shmctl" in linux. I 
searched them on the internet in this whole afternoon and night, but I 
could not find it. Now, I am very depressed. I think this is my last hope 
to ask you for help. Could you please send me the Linux OS source code 
about the "shmget, shmat, shmdt, shmctl"? 

Your help will be greatly appreciated!!!

Best wishes for you!

Sincerely yours,
Haiying Shen
