Yes I know it is questionable, but if prepare_highmem_swapout fails we
are in the highmem area and probably most of the rest of shm is also
there. So we only consume a lot of CPU if going on and calling
prepare_highmem_swapout again and again..

prepare_highmem_swapout should not fail (and does not fail very often
in 2.3.26-pre2) In 2.3.25 the machine effectivly locked up when it
failed (and it failed very often).

On 2.3.26-pre2 I do not see a difference between the two versions. So
I do not know which way will be better.
