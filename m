int ret is defined in two place in madvise_hwpoison. One is out of for
loop and its value is always zero(zero means success for madvise), the 
other one is in for loop. The soft_offline_page function maybe return 
-EBUSY and break, however, the ret out of for loop is return which means 
madvise_hwpoison success.
