Hi there,

is there any description of what address_space is supposed to to?

What are the address_space_operations expected to handle?

Sure, I could look into the sources to find out (and I did
already), but how could I distinguish between a proper
implementation and a BUG?

I searched the archives already (but using address_space as
primary keyword, so I wouldn't get renames) without any luck.

So could somebody please point me to some documentation about it
or comment it, if there is none?

Many thanks!

Regards

Ingo Oeser
