Hi,

after having analyzed a bit the various souces of inefficiency in Linux
(wrt a high end server), and having discarded what other people already
seem to be working on,  I'd like to enroll myself into a zero copy IO
project, much like that of UVM, genie, io-lite, fbufs, etc.

Is anybody aready working on this? Does anybody have ideas about it?
Anybody interested in a discussion of pros and cons of such an
architectural change to Linux?

TIA, ciao,

 - Fabio
