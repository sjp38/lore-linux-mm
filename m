Hi Petr, I'm nearly done putting together a linux-mm archive for
lore.kernel.org (thanks Ben and Rik for providing the raw material).  It's
mostly ready, the only thing left to do is filter the spam.

If you want to provide a place to upload I can give you what I have now, or if
you wait a week or so, it'll be completely done.

Thanks,
Daniel
