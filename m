How about realising that I'm not perfect, and sometimes need reminding
(*after* a reasonable period of about a week or so)?

Rather than just saying "I submitted this, got ignored and gave up" ?

It's a bit like putting a slip of paper in a secretaries tray from your
doctor requesting another appointment in 4 weeks time.  You wait and
wait for notification, which never comes.

What do you do?  Do you give up?  Or do you wait a reasonable time
before telephoning the secretary to find out what's happening?

Guess what I did this morning?  I telephoned the secretary to find
out what was happening.  Result is I now have an appointment.  I didn't
give up.

This is no different.  People forget things.  Things get mislayed.
People have to be constantly hastled to do anything.  That's life.
