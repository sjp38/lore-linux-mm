I checked if crossrelease feature works well on my qemu-i386 machine.
There's no problem at all to work on mine. But I wonder if it's also
true even on other machines. Especially, on large system. Could you
let me know if it doesn't work on yours? Or Could you let me know if
crossrelease feature is useful? Please let me know if you need to
backport it to another version but it's not easy. Then I can provide
the backported version after working it.

I added output text of 'cat /proc/lockdep' on my machine applying
crossrelease feature, showing dependencies of lockdep. You can check
what kind of dependencies are added by crossrelease feature. Please
use '(complete)' or '(PG_locked)' as a keyword to find dependencies
added by this patch set.

-----8<-----

Change from v2
	- rebase on vanilla v4.7 tag
	- move lockdep data for page lock from struct page to page_ext
	- allocate plocks buffer via vmalloc instead of in struct task
	- enhanced comments and document
	- optimize performance
	- make reporting function crossrelease-aware

Change from v1
	- enhanced the document
	- removed save_stack_trace() optimizing patch
	- made this based on the seperated save_stack_trace patchset
	  https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1182242.html

Can we detect deadlocks below with original lockdep?

Example 1)

	PROCESS X	PROCESS Y
	--------------	--------------
	mutext_lock A
			lock_page B
	lock_page B
			mutext_lock A // DEADLOCK
	unlock_page B
			mutext_unlock A
	mutex_unlock A
			unlock_page B

where A and B are different lock classes.

No, we cannot.

Example 2)

	PROCESS X	PROCESS Y	PROCESS Z
	--------------	--------------	--------------
			mutex_lock A
	lock_page B
			lock_page B
					mutext_lock A // DEADLOCK
					mutext_unlock A
					unlock_page B
					(B was held by PROCESS X)
			unlock_page B
			mutex_unlock A

where A and B are different lock classes.

No, we cannot.

Example 3)

	PROCESS X	PROCESS Y
	--------------	--------------
			mutex_lock A
	mutex_lock A
	mutex_unlock A
			wait_for_complete B // DEADLOCK
	complete B
			mutex_unlock A

where A is a lock class and B is a completion variable.

No, we cannot.

Not only lock operations, but also any operations causing to wait or
spin for something can cause deadlock unless it's eventually *released*
by someone. The important point here is that the waiting or spinning
must be *released* by someone.

Using crossrelease feature, we can check dependency and detect deadlock
possibility not only for typical lock, but also for lock_page(),
wait_for_xxx() and so on, which might be released in any context.

See the last patch including the document for more information.
