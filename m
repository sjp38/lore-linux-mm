THere is no problem because the OS will recover.  I don't say it's an
optimal implementation but given that the name is used differently on
different OSes (at least the one without the POSIX_ prefix) people
will have to adjust themselves.

Of course I would prefer if the option in the Linux kernel could do
what POSIX says and simply add a new option for the current behaviour.
But nobody listens to me anyway so why bother.
