I see someone already beat me to this, I guess I should pay better attention. One question though, in my fair about of cluelessness, has anyone a patch specifically for this? Or can someone verify the stability of the 2.3.x kernels that have this support? These machines are extreamly hard hit Oracle servers, so obviously I need as stable a kernel as possible. Any advice on how I should go about upgrading from a 2.2.x kernel towards this end will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
	Javan
