This patch follows several iterations of the memory controller hierarchy
patches. The hardwall approach by Kamezawa-San[1]. Version 1 of this patchset
at [2].

The current approach is based on [2] and has the following properties

1. Hierarchies are very natural in a filesystem like the cgroup filesystem.
   A multi-tree hierarchy has been supported for a long time in filesystems.
   When the feature is turned on, we honor hierarchies such that the root
   accounts for resource usage of all children and limits can be set at
   any point in the hierarchy. Any memory cgroup is limited by limits
   along the hierarchy. The total usage of all children of a node cannot
   exceed the limit of the node.
2. The hierarchy feature is selectable and off by default
3. Hierarchies are expensive and the trade off is depth versus performance.
   Hierarchies can also be completely turned off.

The patches are against 2.6.28-rc2-mm1 and were tested in a KVM instance
with SMP and swap turned on.
