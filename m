Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Suppress page allocator warnings about order >= MAX_ORDER

The page allocator warns once when callers specify an order that is too
high. This is because the path is slow and it's important to verify that
callers are really doing the right thing and recovering by specifying
smaller orders rather than simply falling back to vmalloc().

The problem is that there is no way of suppressing the warning when the
callers are doing the right thing. Patch 1 of this series allows the warning
to be suppressed with __GFP_NOWARN. The second two patches suppress warnings
generated by the profile= and the DCCP network protocol as those callers
are recovering in a sensible fashion.
