I don't understand what you are asking here.

My workflow is:
	- apply patches to a branch and test
	- if good, 'git format-patch' to create the patches
	- merge to my upstream branch and push out publically
	- run script on the patches generated by 'git format-patch' to
	  say they have been applied.

My custom script is the last thing there, that takes the patches, finds
the email addresses in the patch, and notifies everyone.

Does that explain things better?
