I wonder if you are talking exclusively about swap (anonymous) pages,
where lock_page() might work.

(I wonder why lock_page() is needed in do_swap_page(), btw.)

For page caches, usually lock_page() cannot prevent accesses to them,
and there are several kernel functions which don't need PTE mappings
for access.  One of such functions is do_generic_mapping_read().
