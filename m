After an earthquake, fire broke out at a Japanese nuclear plant -- the world's largest in power output. 

A company statement said the leak had stopped and that there had been no "significant change" in the seawater under surveillance and no effect on the environment. 

Security agents rushed them into a basement office for safety and kept them there for about 20 minutes, he said.

A man carrying a gun and declaring "I am the emperor" was shot and killed Monday outside the offices of Gov. Bill Ritter by a security officer, a spokesman said. Ritter was not injured.

Pat Garriott said he was eating in the basement cafeteria when he heard shots.

The plant leaked about 315 gallons of water, said Katsuya Uchino, another Tokyo Electric official.
