It looks like there is a logical problem in the CMA allocator.  The
call in usb_sg_wait() specifies GFP_NOIO, which is supposed to prevent
allocations from blocking on any I/O operations.  Therefore we
shouldn't be waiting for the CMA mutex.

Perhaps the CMA allocator needs to drop the mutex while doing 
writebacks/flushes, or perhaps it needs to be reorganized some other 
way.  I don't know anything about it.

Does the CMA code have any maintainers who might need to know about 
this, or is it all handled by the MM maintainers?
