No problem at all, I know people are busy and merge window is coming so
I did not really expect a lot of movement here.

But since next week I am going to be quite busy and I will be tight in time, 
I just sent the patchset (<20180601125321.30652-1-osalvador@techadventures.net>), so you might want to comment
there in case you want.

Anyway, thanks for the time.
