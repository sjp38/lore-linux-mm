The testing I have done was on top of the complete series. The last
patch should be irrelevant as I have tested the global reclaim but the
second patch might still influence figures a tiny bit (we still do the
soft limit tree thing). That's why I haven't pushed the numbers here.

I can add that information if people prefer or just ask Andrew to squash
the leader email into the first patch as he tend to do quite often in
other cases as well.
