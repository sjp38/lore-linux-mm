Hmm...I think I may need to isolate the fsync/msync flushing against races
with truncate since we are calling into the filesystem directly with
get_block().  Dave (Chinner), does this sound right?

Also, one thing I forgot to mention is that these patches are built upon the
first version of Dave Chinner's XFS patches and my ext2 patches that deal with
the truncate races with DAX.  A snapshot of my development tree with these
patches applied can be found here:
