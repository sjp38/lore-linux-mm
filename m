No, 32 bit Guest OS, but a completely 64 bit userspace on a 64 bit kernel.

Userspace is current Debian Stable. Kernel is Vanilla and qemu-kvm is

It was compiled in.

With the following table set I was able to reproduce the problem on 
3.0-rc2. Replaced my IP with xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, but otherwise unmodified

I've just compiled out CONFIG_BRIDGE_NETFILTER and can no longer access 
the address the way I was doing it, so that's a no-go for me.
