some time ago i think that Rick was doing a patch to allow distributed memory 
(MOSIX needed that , maybe others can use it ?) , but i don't know if has 
been included is in beta or never written. 
I'm interested in looking at it (and test it with several MOSIX machines if 
you need) .
we need anything else to achieve distributed memory  ?   

thanks
