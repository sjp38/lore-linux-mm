Yet it is critical that further investigation of this area take place. The
expression of the agr quorumsensing system already known to affect virulence
factor production may also affect everything from antibiotic resistance to
energy metabolism through its interaction with other staphylococcal gene

The quality of included studies was poor overall  We did not detect bias
induced by any of the measures assessed  We could not obtain data on all
cause fatality for 33% of studies  It is unlikely that missing results would
shift the results for studies comparing the same  lactam relative risk 1 02
0 76 to 1 38 but it is of concern that studies comparing different  lactams
0 85 0 69 to 1 05 may not detect important harm to patients  
None of us had ever seen anyone like her before. having harbored and idea
that I would one day become an actgor, the effect of hearing this
extraordinary person singing I m the greatest star was seismic. As if she
some how knew exactly what was going on in my head. I remember feeling a bit
shivery, as if everyone must be able to see my dream. That the
rags-to-riches scenario was the clichd plot-line of a hundred flicks didnt
matter as I had never encountered it before. But more than anything else was
this voice.
