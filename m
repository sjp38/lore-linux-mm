Subject: [PATCH v2] mm: sections are not offlined during memory hotremove
Date: Fri, 27 Apr 2018 10:52:57 -0400

Memory hotplug, and hotremove operate with per-block granularity. If
machine has large amount of memory (more than 64G), the size of memory
block can span multiple sections. By mistake, during hotremove we set
only the first section to offline state.

The bug was discovered because kernel selftest started to fail:
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20180423011247.GK5563@yexl-desktop

After commit, "mm/memory_hotplug: optimize probe routine". But, the bug is
older than this commit. In this optimization we also added a check for
sections to be in a proper state during hotplug operation.

Fixes: 2d070eab2e82 ("mm: consider zone which is not fully populated to have holes")
