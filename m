Hello freinds,
    I'm currently working on th ein memori file system
.
    Can you provide me some details about the in
memory file system.
    I want to know what is the difference between the
in memori file system & file system in hard disk.
Similarly how we can use the in memory file systems.
    While using the file system in the hard disk
,simply we mount the file system on the desired drive
,how this can be achieved in case of in memory file
system or there is any other method.
    

Rohit...
