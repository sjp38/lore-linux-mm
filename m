I was just testing the 2.4.0-t4-vmpatch patch on test4 and I was very happy
with the performance with everything I was running.  I sent Rik the
results of vmstat and some extra information accouple of times durring my
tests along with what I was doing at the time.  It was very smooth and 
responsive basicly throughout the tests.

Regards,
	khromy
