This happened on Brain v2.0 released February 7th, 1998.  The only relevant 
config option was CONFIG_MALE=y.  The backtrace will be coming out in blog 
form at some time in the near future, but I had to store it in my verbal 
memory for lack of a serial console.  If anyone has any hints on how to 
install netconsole on current Brain modules, I'd greatly appreciate a 
detailed HOWTO on the subject.
