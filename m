CDYV Profits Soaring, Company Forecasts
They Will Be Acquired in Takeover

Exciting New Issue - Get In Now
Unknown and Undervalued Publishing/
Advertising Leader Projecting '05-'06
Sales of 30 Million, .42 EPS

Cody Ventures Corp. OTC - CDYV
Price Range: .35 - .45
10-Day Target: 1.20

Major Breaking News: CDYV Expands Publication into the 
Dallas/Ft.Worth, Texas Metroplex Area Resulting in 
Circulation of 3 Million Copies Monthly. Revenues to 
Exceed 30 Mill Annually with nearly 
15 Mill Bottom-Line Profit.

CDYV positioned as likely takeover candidate by the 
always acquisition-minded leaders of the publishing 
industry capturing sales of 20 Billion. 

CDYV is the leading advertising, printing, and publishing 
Company in Texas specializing in the very high-profit 
sector of community-based weekly publications. As Master 
Publisher for the State of Texas, CDYV reaches 22 million 
people, 254 counties, and over 3,100 towns and cities 
with their "Tidbits" publication featuring local 
advertising in dozens of areas including entertainment, 
real estate/housing, consumer goods and services, and 
major retailers like Walgreens and Dollar General.

CDYV has been in business 4 years and has grown quickly, 
now it is time for them to explode in the public markets. 
CDYV is new to the stock market, having gone public in a 
very quiet manner. So you have a very brief period to 
get in at or near the bottom before share prices soar on 
increased investor awareness. There are very few companies 
that have perfected this niche of advertising platform 
with none being publicly offered starting out at less than 
50 cents per share.

Monthly circulation has jumped from 500,000 to 3 million 
with the additional expansion into Dallas/Ft.Worth, 
translating into over 9 million readers monthly and 
achieving an additional 17 million in annual revenues 
from the Metroplex Area alone. CDYV will also provide the 
necessary printing services for 150 other national 
publishers in their respective states resulting in another 
9.5 million in yearly sales, with 50% to the bottom-line, 
on top of their already explosive, record-shattering figures.

The publishing industry has always been an active leader in 
mergers, takeovers, and acquisitions. Dow Jones (DJ, 37.00, 
PE 32), Gannett (GCI, 79.00, PE 16), Knight-Ridder 
(KRI, 65.00, PE 16), and Tribune Co. (TRB, 40.00, PE 24) 
are just a few examples of industry leaders that have spent 
Billions over the last few years acquiring aggressive and 
profitable newspaper chains and publishing companies. CDYV 
represents the epitome of an attractive buyout target as 
their PE is 1 based on 12 - 18 month sales and earnings 
figures. The industry average PE is 20, indicating that a 
share price of 5.00 for CDYV would be a very conservative 
valuation.

It is only a matter of time before detailed information is 
released out into the investment community. By receiving 
this Email, you are among the first public investors to 
know about CDYV. Get in now before the crowds take it to 
the moon.
