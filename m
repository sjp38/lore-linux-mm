I went ahead and requested a patchwork instance on patchwork.kernel.org
and it's up and running https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-mm/list/
Hopefully someone else will find this useful. It's a nice way to view
Acks/Tested-by for those who pay attention to such things.

Thanks,
Laura

P.S. I put myself down as admin for this, but if anyone else would like
those rights, e-mail me privately.
