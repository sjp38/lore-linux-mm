Waiting for !pagewriteback and writing back page at the beginning of
remap_onepage() are a sort of "easy part".
We need to wait for exclusive access of a page before copying anyway,
and interesting things such as vmtruncate can happen while waiting for
it.

I don't think the code can be much shorter without assuming a single
processor !CONFIG_PREEMPT system.
