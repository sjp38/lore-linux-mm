The above is a nice analysis of the bug and how it came to be
introduced.  But we don't actually have a bug description!  What was
the observeable problem which got fixed?

Such a description will help people understand the importance of the
patch and will help people (eg, distros) who are looking at a user's
bug report and wondering whether your patch will fix it.
