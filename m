Hi,

We tried to run your mem-misc tests(e.g. shm-stress).
So, in order for the binary to run on different OS
(e.g. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3), we need to
recompile of the files using the 'Makefile', right? We
ran into some problems recompiling the files? Is there
anything else that we should do to make the binary
(e.g. shm-stress) work? Many thanks.
