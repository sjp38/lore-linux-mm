HI!

I have just recently started trying to use linux and am trying to find
ways to get information.  I figured this might be a good way!

I am thinking going to get a new soundcard pretty soon and am wondering if
any body has had any experience using the new soundblaster live cards with
Mandrake Linux.  Are they supported?  How easy is it to configure linux
for them?
