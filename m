Yep, probably. but can you please allow me additonal explanation?

In multi threaded OOM case, we have two problematic routine, coredump
and vmscan. Roland's idea can only solve the former. 

But I also interest vmscan quickly exit if OOM received. if other threads
get stuck in vmscan for freeing addional pages (this is very typical because
usually every thread call any syscall and eventually call kmalloc etc), 
recovering oom become very slow even if this doesn't makes deadlock.

Unfortunatelly, vmscan need much refactoring before appling this idea.
then, I didn't include such fixes.

I mean I hope to implement per-process OOM flag even if coredump don't
really need it.

So, I created MMF_OOM patch today. It is just for discussion, still.

Subject: [RFC][PATCH v2] oom: make coredump interruptible

If oom victim process is under core dumping, sending SIGKILL cause
no-op. Unfortunately, coredump need relatively much memory. It mean
OOM vs coredump can makes deadlock.

Then, coredump logic should check the task has received SIGKILL
from OOM.
