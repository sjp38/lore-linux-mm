CC'ing Linus here. How do you want to proceed with that merge ? (IE. so
far nobody objected to the patch itself)

IE. The patch affects all archs, though it's a trivial change every
time, but I'll have stuff in powerpc-next that depends on it, and so I'm
not sure what the right approach is here. Should I put it in the powerpc
tree ?

I also didn't have any formal Ack from anybody, neither mm folks nor
arch maintainers :-)

Cheers,
Ben.
