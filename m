Hi Sanjay,

Sorry if you were made fun of, a little bit - it was in order as your
request was indeed rather stupid.

Anyway, don't take it personally and you can find the source code of the
Linux kernel (for that is what "operating system" is - the kernel) at:

ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4

Regards,
Tigran
