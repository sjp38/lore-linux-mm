Dear Sir/Madam,

First,I must solicit your strictest confidence in this
transaction. This is by virtue of its nature as being
utterly confidential.I am the Secretary of the
Cont-ract Review Panel instituted by His Excelency
President Olusegun Obasanjo to probe/review all
Contracts executed and payments made during the regime
of late General Sani Abacha. I have been mandated by
my colleagues on the Panel to seek your assistance in
the transfer of the sum ofUS$32.4Million into your
Bank Account.

As you may know, the late General Abacha and members
of his government embezzled billions of dollar
sthrough spurious contracts and payments to foreigners
between 1993 - 1998 and this is now the subject of
probe by my Panel. In the course of our review, wehave
discovered this sum of $32.4Million, which the former
dictator could not transfer from the dedicatedaccount
of the Central Bank of Nigeria before his sudden death
in June 1998. It is this amount that my Colleagues and
I have decided to acquire for ourselves through your
assistance.

This assistance becomes crucial because we cannot
acquire the funds in our names and as government
officials we are not allowed to own or operate foreign
bank accounts. We have thus developed a fullproof,
legal and totally risk free scheme through which the
fund can be transferred to your nominated bank account
within a very short time. The scheme is to use our
position and influence on the Panel to present you as
a foreign Contractor beneficiary of the funds. We
shall arrange all documentation to support this claim
and get Approval for the transfer of the funds for
your benefit on our behalf. The scheme is perfected to
be 100% risk free and weare sure the funds can arrive
your Account within 7 -10 working days from when you
agree to assist us. 

You should acknowledge the receipt of my mail through
the above e-mail address so we can further discuss the
modalities of your cooperation and negotiate the
charge for the usage of your Account. You definitely
have a lot to benefit from this transaction as we have
decided to give you 20% of the total sum as soon as
you secure it in your account,and we have also set
aside 5% of the total sum for all expenses incurred in
the course of this transaction.Please, endeavor to
give me a private telephone/faxnumber through which we
can communicate with you inconfidence (in your
response) as the need for secrecy is great to this
transaction.

We expect your urgent response.

Yours faithfully,

DR.SALISU JOHN.
