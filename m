But the info isn't there (only in the mailing lists)  ;(

Mail me the account name you want to have, and I'll set
you up a CVS account with access to the linux-mm site.

I have some things in mind I would like to see changed on
the site, but I can't ask anyone to do it (if you volunteer,
you're probably doing it for your fun...).

However, I'll mention them anyway ;)

- update the TODO list
- see what the people are working on now, remove
  folks who aren't working on the VM and add new
  people
- gather more relevant VM links and add them to 
  the links page
- monitor the mailing lists and keep a reasonably
  up-to-date status of the Linux VM on the page

Since people have suckere^Wconvinced me to write up
a whole load of documentation on the new VM (can you
say "white paper"?), there will be real documents to
add too, soon.  ;)

regards,

Rik
