One of my fears is that BSD one day becomes the "saviour" of
proprietary software due to the fact BSD licensed software can be
reused legally and without provokinhg a scandal who isbad for PR).  So
one day those attacks could be coordinated by companies wanting people
switching from Linux to BSD and then issue a proprietary BSD with
additional bells and whistles.  First step would be in making people
believe that BSD is superior to Linux

No I don't want to start an "editors war" but I need info in order to
restablish truth: I fear co,nsequences of one sided propaganda.  I
catched the BSD people in a couple of occasions while lying by
omission.

I think BSD is probably suprior in some fields but I can't beleieve
there is nothing wheere Linux doesn't beat the pants of BSD.  There is
alw that nothing is superior in every field.
