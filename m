Kthreads are currently implemented as an infinite loop. Each
has its own variant of checks for terminating, freezing,
awakening. In many cases it is unclear to say in which state
it is and sometimes it is done a wrong way.

The plan is to convert kthreads into kthread_worker or workqueues
API. It allows to split the functionality into separate operations.
It helps to make a better structure. Also it defines a clean state
where no locks are taken, IRQs blocked, the kthread might sleep
or even be safely migrated.

The kthread worker API is useful when we want to have a dedicated
single thread for the work. It helps to make sure that it is
available when needed. Also it allows a better control, e.g.
define a scheduling priority.

This patch converts the kmemleak kthread into the kthread worker
API because it modifies the scheduling priority.

The result is a simple self-queuing work that just calls kmemleak_scan().

The info messages and set_user_nice() are moved to the functions that
start and stop the worker. These are also renamed to mention worker
instead of thread.

We do not longer need to handle a spurious wakeup and count the remaining
timeout. It is handled by the worker. The delayed work is queued after
the full timeout passes.

Finally, the initial delay is done only when the kthread is started
during the boot. For this we added a parameter to the start function.
