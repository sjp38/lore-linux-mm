Hi,
I wanted to know how to map a kmalloced merory to multiple 
processes in user space without the file level abstraction as
in 
mmap. I would be happy to have a system call do this.
In my searches so far, I have not been able to come across
something on these lines.

Any inputs, reference implementations, links will be 
appreciated.

Thanks
Aryan
