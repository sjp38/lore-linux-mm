Right.

I think we should have hot-plug interfaces at the module level, not at
the ACPI-internal level.  In this way, the interfaces can be
platform-neutral and allow any modules to register, which makes it more
consistent with the boot-up sequence.  It can also allow ordering of the
sequence among the registered modules.  Right now, we initiate all
procedures from ACPI during hot-plug, which I think is inflexible and
steps into other module's role.

I am also concerned about the slot handling, which is the core piece of
the infrastructure and only allows hot-plug operations on ACPI objects
where slot objects are previously created by checking _EJ0.  The
infrastructure should allow hot-plug operations on any objects, and it
should not be dependent on the slot design.

I have some rough idea, and it may be easier to review / explain if I
make some code changes.  So, let me prototype it, and send it you all if
that works out.  Hopefully, it won't take too long.

The OS can eject an ACPI device because a target device is owned by the
OS (i.e. enabled).  For hot-add, a target ACPI device is not owned by
the OS (i.e. disabled).  Therefore, the OS is not supposed to change its
state.  So, I do not think we should support a hot-add operation by the
OS.

Oh, off-lining no matter what would be problematic for enterprise

Right.
