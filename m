> There is a fundamental deadlock associated with paging;

I know you'd really like people like myself to review this work, but a
set of 40 patches is just too much to try and digest at once
especially when I have other things going on.  When I have lots of
other things already on my plate, when I see a huge patch set like
this I have to just say "delete" because I don't kid myself since
I know I'll never get to it.

Sorry there's now way I can review this with my current workload.
