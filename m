Hi all,

I'd like to try fixing bugs as a way to get more familiar with the VM 
code. Is there a list of known/outstanding bugs that need to be fixed? 
Is http://bugme.osdl.org the place to go or somewhere else? I mean I see 
VM patches posted most everyday but I haven't really found the *source* 
of the patches - are they bug fixes for issues other people found or 
just issues the VM hackers noticed themselves?

Thanks,
Kirk
