Breaking News:  LOS ANGELES, CA, May 25, 2005 (MARKET WIRE via COMTEX) -- May 25, 2005 (MARKET WIRE) - Relay Capital Corp. (RLYC) is launching "My Family(SM)" Dual-Pak stored-value debit cards to serve the multi-billion dollar market for family members who send money to relatives, especially to those in former homelands, or parents who want to provide money to students living away from home quickly, conveniently and cost effectively. 

My Family(SM) cards, which Corporate Network negotiated on behalf of Relay Capital with Ascot Investments, Inc., (www.ascotinc.com) addresses the growing global demand for the rapid, cost-efficient ability to securely send and receive money across town or around the world. It eliminates the sometimes-insurmountable hassles of having to locate and physically get to a facility to send or pick up wired funds. Cash is available within minutes at the nearest affiliated ATM. 

Relay Capital's My Family(SM) card's primary focus is US families sending money to relatives abroad. A primary example is Hispanic immigrants that send money to relatives in their homeland. A recent LOS ANGELES TIMES article entitled, "Funds Sent to Mexico Hit Record" stated, "The central bank of Mexico projected that 2004 remittances would hit $16.3 billion, up 22% over 2003."
