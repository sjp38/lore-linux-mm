Whatever.

It was a honest question but somehow you managed to turn it into
something else. It's
funny that you don't see that it's _you_ that's the biggest obstacle
in getting frontswap
merged. You managed to completely alienate me, for example, with your
style of arguing.

If you had bothered to check your facts before accusing me of being
part of the "KVM
mafia", you'd know that if such mafia existed, it would probably hate
me as much as they
hate you. Furthermore, Sasha Levin who worked on KVM tmem happens to work
on the same project as I do so I was naturally interested in frontswap
until you showed
up.
