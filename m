Hi all,

	Before I ask my question, just to let you know, yes, I did look
for information on the web and various books to see if I could answer
this myself.  Alas, no luck.  Anyways, here goes:

	Just how does an MMU work, and why do we need it to implement
virtual memory instead of handling it all in the kernel?

	I've found quite a few texts on how VM works, but never why we
need an MMU or what an MMU does.

	Can anyone recommend a good book on this?
