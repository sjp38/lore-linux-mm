This part is outdated since 93e06c7a6453 ("mm: enable MADV_FREE for
swapless system") since 4.12. Something to fix in the man page. I will
send a patch for that. Thanks for pointing it out.

Yes this is how MADV_FREE is implemented.

> For example, on a 64 GB RAM machine I have a process taking 30 GB resident memory ("RES" in tools like htop). After I put on memory pressure (for example using `stress-ng --vm-bytes 1G --vm-keep -m 50` to allocate and touch 50 GB), RES for that process decreases to 10 GB.

Those pages get reclaimed under memory pressure.

yep.

It used to be like that.

We batch multiple pages to become really lazyfree. This means that those
pages are sitting on a per-cpu list (see mark_page_lazyfree). So the
the number drift depends on the number of CPUs.

What would be the reason to get the exact number?
