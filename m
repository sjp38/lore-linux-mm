Not sure what you were testing, but I suspect it is related to my
procmail rules breaking for linux-mm.  Upon investigation I noticed that
the Original-Recipient: header is now missing.  Bummer, about two dozen
mails to move manually after adjusting the rules to match what kvack is
sending.

Just out of curiosity, why this change?
