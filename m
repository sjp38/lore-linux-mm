I would like to attend LSF/MM. I'm interested in discussion about
huge page, improving page migration feature and testing in MM.
And I also want to know long-term goals on MM.

I'm working in the MM area for two years now, and I've been improving
slab/slub performance and fixing hugetlb bugs. Recently, I'm digging
into page migration feature.

Thanks.
