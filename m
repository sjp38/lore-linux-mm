Breaking News!!

June 6- Nomad International Inc. (NDIN) announced today it has 
concluded the definitive agreement to provide an exclusive license for its VoIP 
products with LMB Technologies Inc. for the Caribbean market which 
includes Bermuda.

The terms of the agreement provides for a 20% royalty payable to Nomad 
of the gross revenue generated by LMB Technologies Inc. of any sales 
and other revenue generated from the license. Additional consideration 
payable to Nomad includes 20% of the common stock of LMB Technologies 
Inc. which will seek a public listing of its common shares in the U.S. 
market as soon as practicably possible.

The significance of this transaction to Nomad is the fact that of the 
total population in the Caribbean basin, the growth in the use of the 
internet from the year 2000 to present day is over 300%. Of this growth, 
the majority has been dial up use considering the infrastructure 
issues. The Nomad technology addresses these issues through its ability to 
0ffer VoIP services over dial up enabled service providers.

Considering the lack of broadband infrastructure in the region, Nomad's 
products potentially have an advantage, supporting this theory is the 
lack of major North American VoIP provider presence in the Caribbean 
market.

"Our relationship with LMB is an exciting development for Nomad, given 
the up surge in internet usage in the Caribbean basin and our ability 
to provide VoIP connectivity through dial up service providers", stated 
Jan Olivier, CEO and Chairman of Nomad International Inc.

approvals of LMB Technologies Inc. and Nomad International Inc.

0pp0rtunity to potentially gain market share through our ability to provide VoIP 
services over dial up networks. We are please with the distribution

Caribbean market commercially in the short term.!?, stated Jan Olivier,
