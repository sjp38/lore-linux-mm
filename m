	Dear Sir,

	You have posted to mailing list with several dozens of subscribers
requesting them to send about a gigabyte of gzipped sources to address
sanjay.bh@philips.com. We regret to inform you that your request can
not be processed unless you use the proper form. Correct way is to put

X-Mailbomb-To: <address>
X-Mailbomb-Size: <size>

in headers and leave the message body empty. Please, resubmit your request
using the right form so that it could be processed. Thank you for
cooperation.
						The Management.
