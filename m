Hi,

I managed to salvage the important partitions from my crashed
HD, and I'm back in business now...

I've seen quite some mm patches floating around, and I've
actually read (and even written) some of them.
Now I wonder if anyone would be interested in a central
place where all mm patches could accumulate / be found /
be merged... I know I would.

To put it in another way: I'm thinking of starting a mm-patch
www-page (a'la linux-mama) where all memory management related
patches can be found. So now I put out this request for all
mm-authors whether they can send me:
- a description of their patch
- a pointer as to where I can find it
- possibly even an updated patch (up-to-date with current kernel release)

Then we can assess what features are floating around, and how
we can make Linux:
- more stable
- faster
- more feature-rich
(in order of importance?)

grtz,

Rik.

Send Linux memory-management wishes to me: I'm currently looking
for something to hack...
