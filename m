We tried hard.  The slowdown wasn't all that much on system
benchmarks, but you could see it on the microbenchmarks.  And it made
stuff a LOT cleaner.

We wanted it to put super-page friendly pagetables in for
architectures not wedded to the 3/4 level x86 pagetable hardware
format. 

The people I had working on this left (finished a masters,
finished a PhD, contract ran out and no more money), and I haven't had
the manpower to maintain the patchset, especially after the negative
responses we got from linux-MM.
