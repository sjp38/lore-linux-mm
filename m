Subject: [PATCH 03/18] writeback: implement wb_domain

Dirtyable memory is distributed to a wb (bdi_writeback) according to
the relative bandwidth the wb is writing out in the whole system.
This distribution is global - each wb is measured against all other
wb's and gets the proportinately sized portion of the memory in the
whole system.

For cgroup writeback, the amount of dirtyable memory is scoped by
memcg and thus each wb would need to be measured and controlled in its
memcg.  IOW, a wb will belong to two writeback domains - the global
and memcg domains.

Currently, what constitutes the global writeback domain are scattered
across a number of global states.  This patch starts collecting them
into struct wb_domain.

* fprop_global which serves as the basis for proportional bandwidth
  measurement and its period timer are moved into struct wb_domain.

* global_wb_domain hosts the states for the global domain.

* While at it, flatten wb_writeout_fraction() into its callers.  This
  thin wrapper doesn't provide any actual benefits while getting in
  the way.

This is pure reorganization and doesn't introduce any behavioral
changes.
