You mean, just modified the  code as bellow ?
in function  domain_dirty_limits()
-        if (bg_thresh >= thresh)
+     if (bg_thresh >= thresh) {
+        pr_warn("vm direct limit should greater than background limit.\n");
          bg_thresh = thresh / 2;
+     }

will this generate lots of log ?

Thanks
Yafang
