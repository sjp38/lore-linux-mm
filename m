Is there any chance that some knowledgeable people could write docs for
the public functions in 2.4's linux/mm directory?

I'm gonna finish up documenting kernel/*, drivers/pci* and a few drivers
in drivers/net soon.  mm/* is a hole in my knowledge, though, so I need
to solicit for volunteers.

It would be nice to silence the people complaining about the kernel's
lack of internal docs. :)
