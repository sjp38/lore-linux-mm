Revenues

Consolidated operating revenue for the three-month period ended 
June 30, 2005 was $1,697,000, compared to $336,000 
for the same corresponding period in year 2004, an increase of $1,361,000 
or 405.1%. The increase was mainly the result of an increase in revenues generated 
from our business segments.

Of the $1,697,000 revenue in the three-month period ended June 30, 2005, 
approximately $216,000 or 12.7% was generated from providing club related services 
by Guangzhou World Trade Center Club and Beijing World Trade Center Club, 
$1,091,000 or 64.3% was generated from business travel services resulting 
from the acquisition of the New Generation Group, and $325,000 or 19.2% 
from business value-added services, and the remaining $65,000 or 3.8% 
from other businesses. The acquisition of New Generation 
and the continuous development of China WTC's business value-added services 
should continue to contribute positively to the Company's operating revenue.

The Company's segmental mix of operating revenues continued to shift since 
its acquisition of the travel business and further development of its 
business value-added services. China WTC will continue to utilize 
the World Trade Center Clubs in various major cities in China to provide 
the necessary platform for the continued growth of its businesses.


Gross Profit

Consolidated gross profit increased by $624,000 or 358.6% for the three-month period 
ended June 30, 2005 over the same corresponding period in year 2004. 
The increase was predominantly driven by China WTC's business travel services 
and by the Company's business value-added services resulting from providing various 
consultancy services to our members.

As a percentage of total operating revenues, the consolidated gross profit margin 
of 47.0% for the three-month period ended 2005 decreased from 51.8% 
for the same corresponding period in 2004. China WTC's profit margin was driven 
by a mix shift from lower margin trading business to higher margin business 
travel services. However, the lower profit margin as a percent of operating revenues 
for the three-month period ended June 30, 2005 as compared to the same 
corresponding period in 2004 was primarily contributed by the negative margin 
from the Company's business value-added services. The shift in segmental distribution 
was primarily due to the increase in gross profit in the business travel services. 
We foresee that this segment mix will continue to change and balance out 
in year 2005 upon further development of the business value-added services.


Travel Business

China World Trade Corporation has commenced its operation in the travel business 
since the Company's acquisition of New Generation in August 2004. 
For the three-month period ended June 30, 2005, New Generation sold a total 
of over 310,000 tickets, which translates to a total value of air-ticket fare 
of approximately $34.4 million. As compared to the same corresponding period 
in year 2004, ticket sold of New Generation increased by 73,000 tickets or 30.8% 
from approximately 237,000 tickets with value of air-ticket fare increased 
by $7.0 million or 25.5% from $27.4 million.
