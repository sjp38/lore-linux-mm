I rechecked and I guarantee that the patches where Christoph isn't
listed are developed by myself and he didn't write a single line on
them. In any case I expect Christoph to review (he's CCed) and to
point me to any attribution error. The only mistake I did once in that
area was to give too _few_ attribution to myself and he asked me to
add myself in the signed-off so I added myself by Christoph own
request, but be sure I didn't remove him!
