HOW TO 'PICK UP' BEAUTIFUL WOMEN by John Eagan,  
THE BOOK THAT IS GETTING NOTICED! 

PENTHOUSE  MAGAZINE  promoted  the author, John Eagan, 
as a "Miracle Worker."

Penthouse Magazine's July '99 cover says "Getting
Beautiful Girls - Self Styled Pick Up Guru Shares His
'Super Techniques.'" According to Penthouse Magazine, John
Eagan had to take out an individual named "Bill." 
Penthouse described it as follows -(page 132) "John's got
his work cut out for him with Bill who is in his 40's,
balding, wears glasses and sports an ill advised goatee." 
Yet Penthouse  goes on to say that Bill, using John Eagan's
techniques, (page 133) "obtained 3 women's phone numbers
that night." 

On November 20th '99, John Eagan - author of the book
"How To Pick Up Beautiful Women" - appeared as a guest 
on the Howard Stern Radio Show, CBS TV.  According to
Howard Stern, John Eagan was asked to go out with the E!
crew and their hidden cameras to get dates for some of
their interns.  Howard said the interns were the ugliest
guys he could find.  John Eagan had to coach the interns
with his techniques by speaking into the interns ear
pieces.  Using John Eagan's techniques, these interns got
dates with beautiful girls. Howard said "This guy is no 
bull, I've seen him in action. He's the real deal."
