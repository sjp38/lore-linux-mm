Hello,

We offer accommodation services and I thought you might be interested 
in link exchange. We provide several travel-related sites, one of them is

http://www.prague-hotel.co.uk

Due to the possible harming nature of too many reciprocal links we 
suggest non reciprocal links. You can link to us from your site and we
will link back from another of our sites.


I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best Regards,
Peter
