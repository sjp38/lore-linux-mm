Subject: [PATCH v2 0/3] fix free pmd/pte page handlings on x86

This series fixes two issues in the x86 ioremap free page handlings
for pud/pmd mappings.

Patch 01 fixes BUG_ON on x86-PAE reported by Joerg.  It disables
the free page handling on x86-PAE.

Patch 02-03 fixes a possible issue with speculation which can cause
stale page-directory cache.
 - Patch 02 is from Chintan's v9 01/04 patch [1], which adds a new arg
   'addr'.  This avoids merge conflicts with his series.
 - Patch 03 adds a TLB purge (INVLPG) to purge page-structure caches
   that may be cached by speculation.  See the patch descriptions for
   more detal.

v2:
 - Reordered patch-set, so that patch 01 can be applied independently.
 - Added a NULL pointer check for the page alloc in patch 03.
