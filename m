hi

can some1 explain the memory limits on the 2.4 kernel

- what is the maximum amount of physical memory it supports ?
- what is the limit for user-space apps ?
- what is the limit for kernel ?
- are there any limits on malloc, static-memory, stack-memory ?
- does using HIGHMEM results with performance penalty   ?
- anything else ?

please CC me for any answer

regards
Benhanokh Gabriel
