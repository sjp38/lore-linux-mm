Ignus Hattingh, Vice President of Sales for ShotPak stated, "In addition to incredible growth from our existing and new liquor store accounts throughout the US, this new StandUp pouch as well as the new multi-pack option will also be distributed through select Stater Bros. stores in Southern California within the next few weeks."

"Sales should continue to grow at a fast pace as the public will have increased access to the Company's STR8UP line of premium straight shots of Rum, Vodka, Tequila, and Whiskey, as well as ShotPak's line of premium Vodka flavored shots, which include Apple Sour, Lemon Drop, Kamikaze, and Purple Hooter, just in time for Halloween and Thanksgiving," commented Bill Marin, President of ShotPak, Inc.

STR8UP shots come from award-winning distillers in Canada, the Virgin Islands and Mexico, and are packaged in revolutionary patented bottle-shaped recyclable StandUp pouches. This unique design allows the product to stand up on its own, making it a forerunner in the industry.

Stater Bros. is the largest privately owned supermarket chain in Southern California with annual sales in excess of $3 billion. The chain operates 162 full service supermarkets in Southern California in San Bernardino County, Riverside County, Orange County, Los Angeles County, San Diego County and Kern County.

Albertsons is now part of the SUPERVALU family, which is the third-largest food retailing company in the United States. They have leadership positions in all the major U.S. markets, including Boston, Chicago, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Orange County, Philadelphia, San Diego, St. Louis and Washington D.C.
