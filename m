/proc/pid/oom_adj is now deprecated so that that it may eventually be
removed.  The target date for removal is December 2011.

A warning will be printed to the kernel log if a task attempts to use
this interface.  Future warning will be suppressed until the kernel is
rebooted to prevent spamming the kernel log.

+What:	/proc/<pid>/oom_adj
+When:	December 2011
+Why:	/proc/<pid>/oom_adj allows userspace to influence the oom killer's
+	badness heuristic used to determine which task to kill when the kernel
+	is out of memory.
+
+	The badness heuristic has since been rewritten since the introduction of
+	this tunable such that its meaning is deprecated.  The value was
+	implemented as a bitshift on a score generated by the badness()
+	function that did not have any precise units of measure.  With the
+	rewrite, the score is given as a proportion of available memory to the
+	task allocating pages, so using a bitshift which grows the score
+	exponentially is, thus, impossible to tune with fine granularity.
+
+	A much more powerful interface, /proc/<pid>/oom_score_adj, was
+	introduced with the oom killer rewrite that allows users to increase or
+	decrease the badness() score linearly.  This interface will replace
+	/proc/<pid>/oom_adj.
+
+	See Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt for information on how to use the
+	new tunable.
+
+	A warning will be emitted to the kernel log if an application uses this
+	deprecated interface.  After it is printed once, future warning will be
+	suppressed until the kernel is rebooted.

 Caveat: when a parent task is selected, the oom killer will sacrifice any first
 generation children with seperate address spaces instead, if possible.  This
 avoids servers and important system daemons from being killed and loses the
