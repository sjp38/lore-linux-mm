Dear sir,

1. I have problem in locating the source code of linux operating system
because i dont know in which path it is kept. Pls suggest me the pathname.

2. let me know the different ways to connect the device drivers module to
the kernel.

3. let me know where actually the space for SWAPPING, BUFFERS  are
allocated. i mean whether they are in RAM Memory or Hard disk drive.

Thanks in advance for the help.


Thanks and regards
Heerappa.
