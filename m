The existing scritpts won't work correctly. That's also what I have
worried before.

But under this condition, there's a error message generated by "sysctl
-w" to tell them the first setting was failure.
This error message may be a reminder to them that there are some
connections between background and direct limit, and should not set
arbitrary.
May that's better. I'm not sure.
