HI, folks

I'd like to attend LSF/MM summit, been very interested in the
discussion related to VFS, xfs, btrfs, ext4, and memory management;
and would like to share the status of VFS hot tracking if possible.

In the past one year, i'd worked on some new xfs features and
submitted some fs bugfixes.
