Slab defragmentation may occur:

1. Unconditionally when kmem_cache_shrink is called on a slab cache by the
   kernel calling kmem_cache_shrink.

2. Through the use of the slabinfo command.

3. Per node defrag conditionally when kmem_cache_defrag(<node>) is called
   (can be called from reclaim code with a later patch).

   Defragmentation is only performed if the fragmentation of the slab
   is lower than the specified percentage. Fragmentation ratios are measured
   by calculating the percentage of objects in use compared to the total
   number of objects that the slab page can accomodate.

   The scanning of slab caches is optimized because the
   defragmentable slabs come first on the list. Thus we can terminate scans
   on the first slab encountered that does not support defragmentation.

   kmem_cache_defrag() takes a node parameter. This can either be -1 if
   defragmentation should be performed on all nodes, or a node number.

A couple of functions must be setup via a call to kmem_cache_setup_defrag()
in order for a slabcache to support defragmentation. These are

kmem_defrag_isolate_func (void *isolate(struct kmem_cache *s, void **objects, int nr))

	Must stabilize that the objects and ensure that they will not be freed until
	the migration function is complete. SLUB guarantees that
	the objects are still allocated. However, other threads may be blocked
	in slab_free() attempting to free objects in the slab. These may succeed
	as soon as isolate() returns to the slab allocator. The function must
	be able to detect such situations and void the attempts to free such
	objects (by for example voiding the corresponding entry in the objects
	array).

	No slab operations may be performed in isolate(). Interrupts
	are disabled. What can be done is very limited. The slab lock
	for the page that contains the object is taken. Any attempt to perform
	a slab operation may lead to a deadlock.

	kmem_defrag_isolate_func returns a private pointer that is passed to
	kmem_defrag_kick_func(). Should we be unable to obtain all references
	then that pointer may indicate to the kick() function that it should
	not attempt any object removal or move but simply undo the measure
	that were used to stabilize the object.

kmem_defrag_migrate_func (void migrate(struct kmem_cache *, void **objects, int nr,
			int node, void *get_result))

	After SLUB has stabilzed the objects in a
	slab it will then drop all locks and use migrate() to move objects out
	of the slab. The existence of the object is guaranteed by virtue of
	the earlier obtained references via kmem_defrag_get_func(). The
	callback may perform any slab operation since no locks are held at
	the time of call.

	The callback should remove the object from the slab in some way. This
	may be accomplished by reclaiming the object and then running
	kmem_cache_free() or reallocating it and then running
	kmem_cache_free(). Reallocation is advantageous because the partial
	slabs were just sorted to have the partial slabs with the most objects
	first. Reallocation is likely to result in filling up a slab in
	addition to freeing up one slab. A filled up slab can also be removed
	from the partial list. So there could be a double effect.

	kmem_defrag_migrate_func() does not return a result. SLUB will check
	the number of remaining objects in the slab. If all objects were
	removed then the slab is freed and we have reduced the overall
	fragmentation of the slab cache.
