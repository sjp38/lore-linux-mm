What do you mean by slab reclaim? SLOB doesn't have slabs and it
never keeps around unused pages so I can't see how it would be able
to do anything more useful. SLOB is fully functional here, on my 4GB
desktop system, even.

The numbers indicate that SLUB would be the one which is not functional
in a tiny memory constrained environment ;)

Here is the one I used for SLOB (SLUB is otherwise the same, and
without SLOB_DEBUG). BTW, the system booted fine with SLUB and the
fix you sent.
