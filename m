   You're right, the differences between FreeBSD VM and the new
   Linux VM should be clearly indicated.

   Indeed. The amount of documentation (books? nah..) on VM
   is so sparse that it would be good to have both systems
   properly documented. That would fill a void in CS theory
   and documentation that was painfully there while I was
   trying to find useful information to help with the design
   of the new Linux VM...

... and you know, once written, it would make a *wonderful* paper to
present at Freenix or for ALS.... (speaking as someone who has been on
program committees for both conferences :-)
