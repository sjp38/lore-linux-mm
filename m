Thanks Aaron for sharing your experiment results.
That's a good analysis of the effect of the batch value.
I agree with your conclusion.

 From networking perspective, we should reconsider the defaults to be 
able to reach the increasing NICs linerates.
Not only for pcp->batch, but also for pcp->high.
