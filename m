Hi,

I have seen incomplete emails coming from kvack.org mailing list
recently. I cannot say since when because I have ignored it for some
time as I thought that it was an issue in my email configuration and
also I am dropping duplicate emails (which is the case for many of them
due to cross posting to lkml) and I am not directly controlling which
one stays. Finally, it doesn't look to happen very often.

If you compare the same email sent to both kvack[1] and lkml[2] you can
see that the one from lkml is complete while the one from kvack is
incomplete so it doesn't look related to my mail server configuration

Is this a known issue?
