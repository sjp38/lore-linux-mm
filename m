Hello,

I'd like to attend LSF/MM 2014. Whether expose persitent memory
directly to the CPU or hide it behind a PCIe IO controller, I'm
interested to learn/discuss the short and long term mechanisms that
exploiting its benefits of fast, bytes-addressable, non-volatile.

Last year I mainly worked on memcg, and recently I begin to look at io
stack layers for some developments, such as blk-mq, device mapper,
scsi etc. I'm also interested in related topics.
