true. But it is a side-effect of x86 cpu implicitly defining
'disable-access' as a combination of 'disable-read' and 'disable_write'.
In other words, if you disable-access on a pte on x86, you are
automatically disabling read and disabling write on that page.
The software/kernel just happens to explicitly capture that implicit
behavior.

Actually none of the above flags, interact with execute permission. They
operate independently; both on x86 and on POWER.  But yes, this
statement needs to be documented somewhere.
