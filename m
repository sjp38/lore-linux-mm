Dear Sir:

Sorry to write the mail to trouble you.

I am a master student of Chalmers University of Technology,Sweden.

Now I am doing my master thesis: "realtime scheduling in linux kernel",
one of our basic data structure is the AVL tree.

I have searched the code avltree.c(Generic AVL-Tree) as the PATCH of
linux 2.3.30. But I cannot find the included header file avltree.h.
If possible, Could you please give me your hand to send that file to me?
That file is important for us to understand the code. BTW, I have tried to
write to the responsible author Kevin O'Connor, but his email address has
been expired.

Thank you so much for your kind help.

with best regards

Jerry Xu
