Thanks Andi for your effort to present your case more completely.
I agree that there is some 'talking by each other' going on.

Dave Hansen has publically (and Ray privately) sought to
move this discussion to linux-mm (or more specifically,
off lkml for now).

Any chance, Andi, that you could repost this, in response
to Ray's restarting this thread on linux-mm, once he gets
around to that?

I will reserve my response until I see if that works out.

Thanks.
