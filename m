+The Valid Access Checker (VCHECKER)
+===================================
+
+Overview
+--------
+Vchecker is a dynamic memory error detector. It provides a new debug feature
+that can find out an un-intended access to valid area. Valid area here means
+the memory which is allocated and allowed to be accessed by memory owner and
+un-intended access means the read/write that is initiated by non-owner.
+Usual problem of this class is memory overwritten.
+
+Most of debug feature focused on finding out un-intended access to
+in-valid area, for example, out-of-bound access and use-after-free, and,
+there are many good tools for it. But, as far as I know, there is no good tool
+to find out un-intended access to valid area. This kind of problem is really
+hard to solve so this tool would be very useful.
+
+This tool doesn't automatically catch a problem. Manual configuration to
+specify the target object is required. See the usage part on the below.
+
+Usage
+-----
+
+To enable vchecker configure kernel with
+
+::
+
+	CONFIG_VCHECKER = y
+
+and choose the target slab object type and the type of the checkers by debugfs
+interface at the runtime. Following is the hierarchy of the interface.
+
+::
+
+	- debugfs root for vchecker
+		- directory per slab cache
+			- alloc_filter
+			- callstack_depth
+			- enable
+			- value
+			- callstack
+
+
+alloc_filter can be used to apply the checker to specific allocation caller
+for this slab cache. For example, there are multiple users for kmalloc-N
+slab cache and it's better to filter out un-related allocation caller
+when debugging. Note that, if alloc_filter is specified, vchecker doesn't
+regard existing allocated objects as debugging target since it's not easy
+to know the allocation caller for existing allocated objects.
+
+callstack_depth can be used to limit the depth of callstack. It would be
+helpful to reduce overhead.
+
+enable can be used to begin/end the checker for this slab cache.
+
+There are two checkers now, value checker and callstack checker.
+
+Value checker checks the value stored in the target object.
+See following example.
+
+::
+
+	static void workfn(struct work_struct *work)
+	{
+		struct object *obj;
+		struct delayed_work *dwork = (struct delayed_work *)work;
+
+		obj = kmem_cache_alloc(s, GFP_KERNEL);
+
+		obj->v[0] = 7;
+		obj->v[0] = 0;
+
+		kmem_cache_free(s, obj);
+		mod_delayed_work(system_wq, dwork, HZ);
+	}
+
+Assume that v[0] should not be the value, 7, however, there is a code
+to set v[0] to the value, 7. To detect this error, register the value checker
+for this object and specify that invalid value is '7'. After registration,
+if someone stores '7' to this object, the error will be reported. Registration
+can be done by three parameter as following.
+
+::
+
+	# cd /sys/kernel/debug/vchecker
+	# echo 0 0xffff 7 > [slab cache]/value
+		// offset 0 (dec)
+		// mask 0xffff (hex)
+		// value 7 (dec)
+	# echo 1 > [slab cache]/enable
+
+Before describing the each parameters, one thing should be noted. One value
+checker works for 8 bytes at maximum. If more bytes should be checked,
+please register multiple value checkers.
+
+First parameter is a target offset from the object base. It should be aligned
+by 8 bytes due to implementation constraint. Second parameter is a mask that
+is used to specify the range in the specified 8 bytes. Occasionally, we want to
+check just 1 byte or 1 bit and this mask makes it possible to check such
+a small range. Third parameter is the value that is assumed as invalid.
+
+Second checker is the callstack checker. It checks the read/write callstack
+of the target object. Overwritten problem usually happens by non-owner and
+it would have odd callstack. By checking the oddity of the callstack, vchecker
+can report the possible error candidate. Currently, the oddity of the callstack
+is naively determined by checking whether it is a new callstack or not. It can
+be extended to use whitelist but not yet implemented.
+
+::
+
+	# echo 0 8 > [slab cache]/callstack
+		// offset 0 (dec)
+		// size 8 (dec)
+	# echo 1 > [slab cache]/enable
+
+First parameter is a target offset as usual and the second one is the size to
+determine the range. Unlike the value checker, callstack checker can check
+more than 8 bytes by just one checker.
+
+::
+
+	# echo off > [slab cache]/callstack
+		// ... (do some work to collect enough valid callstacks) ...
+	# echo on > [slab cache]/callstack
+
+You can collect potential valid callstack during 'off state'. If you think
+that enough callstacks are collected, turn on the checker. It will report
+a new callstack and it may be a bug candidate.
+
+Error reports
+-------------
+
+Report format looks very similar with the report of KASAN

+
+It shows that vchecker find the invalid value writing
+at workfn_old_obj+0x14/0x50. Object information is also reported.
+
+Implementation details
+----------------------
+This part requires some understanding of how KASAN works since vchecker is
+highly depends on shadow memory of KASAN. Vchecker uses the shadow to
+distinguish interesting memory address for validation. If it finds the special
+value on the shadow of the accessing address, it means that this address is
+the target for validation check. Then, it tries to do additional checks to this
+address. With this way, vchecker can filter out un-interesting memory access
+very efficiently.
+
+A new type of checks can be added by implementing following callback structure.
+check() callback is the main function that checks whether the access is valid
+or not. Please reference existing checkers for more information.
+
+::
+
+	struct vchecker_type {
+		char *name;
+		const struct file_operations *fops;
+		int (*init)(struct kmem_cache *s, struct vchecker_cb *cb,
+				char *buf, size_t cnt);
+		void (*fini)(struct vchecker_cb *cb);
+		void (*show)(struct kmem_cache *s, struct seq_file *f,
+				struct vchecker_cb *cb, void *object, bool verbose);
+		bool (*check)(struct kmem_cache *s, struct vchecker_cb *cb,
+				void *object, bool write, unsigned long ret_ip,
+				unsigned long begin, unsigned long end);
+	};
