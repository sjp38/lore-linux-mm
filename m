That's up to the owning filesystem (or device file, I suppose); hence
"filesystem-specific". I could expand this a little, but there isn't much to
say - it's entirely up to the filesystem, though I think I should probably
require it to be cleared before the page is freed.

> Currently, mm/page_alloc.c clears this flag:

Not really; that's irrelevant. It checks to see if it is set when it allocates
a page, and if it is it complains bitterly. It then splats this bit and all
others to make sure struct page has all its flags in the ground state.

I did have it as a different number, but I was told to make it the same as
PG_checked. I could rename all instances of PG_checked, I suppose...

Fix it then.
