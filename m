This all is a very good background information suitable for the cover
letter.

But this and the following paragraphs are referring to the later step
when the madvise gains a remote process capabilities and that is out
of the scope of this patch series so I would simply remove it from
here. Andrew tends to put the cover letter into the first patch of the
series and that would be indeed
confusing here.
