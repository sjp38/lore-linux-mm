Folks,

A number of subscribers (>10) have had mail bounces over the past 
couple of days due to content filtering tripping up on legit email 
discussions.  I don't mind if this happens due to spam, but do 
expect to be unsubscribed if it happens for normal discussions.  The 
biggest offender seems to be intel's system that thinks almost all 
discussions are one of the current email worms.  Also, HTML is not 
permitted on any of the mailing lists @kvack.org.  Thanks,

		-ben (aka postmaster @kvack.org)
