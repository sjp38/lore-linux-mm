Hi Friends,

   I want to know how to get starting address of a
kernel module. For example if we an executable file by
reading header of that file we can get starting
address of that prog in memory. But it is difficult to
find starting address of a module by examining the
header as it will be a relocatable file. Is there any
way of getting it ? 

Regards
Venkat
