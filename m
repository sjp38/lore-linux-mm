Subject: [PATCH V4 10/15] mm, compaction: remember position within pageblock in free pages scanner

Unlike the migration scanner, the free scanner remembers the beginning of the
last scanned pageblock in cc->free_pfn. It might be therefore rescanning pages
uselessly when called several times during single compaction. This might have
been useful when pages were returned to the buddy allocator after a failed
migration, but this is no longer the case.

This patch changes the meaning of cc->free_pfn so that if it points to a
middle of a pageblock, that pageblock is scanned only from cc->free_pfn to the
end. isolate_freepages_block() will record the pfn of the last page it looked
at, which is then used to update cc->free_pfn.

In the mmtests stress-highalloc benchmark, this has resulted in lowering the
ratio between pages scanned by both scanners, from 2.5 free pages per migrate
page, to 2.25 free pages per migrate page, without affecting success rates.

With __GFP_NO_KSWAPD allocations, this appears to result in a worse ratio (2.1
instead of 1.8), but page migration successes increased by 10%, so this could
mean that more useful work can be done until need_resched() aborts this kind
of compaction.
