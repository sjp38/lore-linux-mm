What's different about ISA v3.0 that means that the protection_map[]
entries need to be different?

If it's just different bit assignments for things like _PAGE_READ
etc., couldn't we fix this up at early boot time by writing new values
into protection_map[]?  Is there a reason why that wouldn't work, or
why you don't want to do that?
