Hi,

Thanks for the diffs, Ben.  I'll have a closer look at them tomorrow.

Unfortunately I've been a bit laid back with a persistant cold for over
a week, but I've shaken it off now and have got the irq/smp-safe page
cache diffs ready for testing.  Another two or three days and that
should be usable, so we can start to think about integrating the two
branches.
