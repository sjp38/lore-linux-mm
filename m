Hi,

This patchset brings multipage bvec into block layer:

1) what is multipage bvec?

Multipage bvecs means that one 'struct bio_bvec' can hold
multiple pages which are physically contiguous instead
of one single page used in linux kernel for long time.

2) why is multipage bvec introduced?

Kent proposed the idea[1] first. 

As system's RAM becomes much bigger than before, and 
at the same time huge page, transparent huge page and
memory compaction are widely used, it is a bit easy now
to see physically contiguous pages from fs in I/O.
On the other hand, from block layer's view, it isn't
necessary to store intermediate pages into bvec, and
it is enough to just store the physicallly contiguous
'segment' in each io vector.

Also huge pages are being brought to filesystem and swap
[2][6], we can do IO on a hugepage each time[3], which
requires that one bio can transfer at least one huge page
one time. Turns out it isn't flexiable to change BIO_MAX_PAGES
simply[3][5]. Multipage bvec can fit in this case very well.

With multipage bvec:

- segment handling in block layer can be improved much
in future since it should be quite easy to convert
multipage bvec into segment easily. For example, we might 
just store segment in each bvec directly in future.

- bio size can be increased and it should improve some
high-bandwidth IO case in theory[4].

- Inside block layer, both bio splitting and sg map can
become more efficient than before by just traversing the
physically contiguous 'segment' instead of each page.

- there is opportunity in future to improve memory footprint
of bvecs. 

3) how is multipage bvec implemented in this patchset?

The 1st 18 patches comment on some special cases and deal with
some special cases of direct access to bvec table.

The 2nd part(19~29) implements multipage bvec in block layer:

	- put all tricks into bvec/bio/rq iterators, and as far as
	drivers and fs use these standard iterators, they are happy
	with multipage bvec

	- use multipage bvec to split bio and map sg

	- bio_for_each_segment_all() changes
	this helper pass pointer of each bvec directly to user, and
	it has to be changed. Two new helpers(bio_for_each_segment_all_sp()
	and bio_for_each_segment_all_mp()) are introduced. 

The 3rd part(30~49) convert current users of bio_for_each_segment_all()
to bio_for_each_segment_all_sp()/bio_for_each_segment_all_mp().

The last part(50~51) enables multipage bvec.

These patches can be found in the following git tree:

	https://github.com/ming1/linux/commits/mp-bvec-1.4-v4.12-rc

Thanks Christoph for looking at the early version and providing
very good suggestions, such as: introduce bio_init_with_vec_table(),
remove another unnecessary helpers for cleanup and so on.

Any comments are welcome!

V2:
	- bvec table direct access in raid has been cleaned, so NO_MP
	flag is dropped
	- rebase on recent Neil Brown's change on bio and bounce code
	- reorganize the patchset

V1:
	- against v4.10-rc1 and some cleanup in V0 are in -linus already
	- handle queue_virt_boundary() in mp bvec change and make NVMe happy
	- further BTRFS cleanup
	- remove QUEUE_FLAG_SPLIT_MP
	- rename for two new helpers of bio_for_each_segment_all()
	- fix bounce convertion
	- address comments in V0
