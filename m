I haven't seen the patch.

In fact, I'm not on the linux-mm mailing list, so if people think that I
pick up patches from there, or pick up reasons for patches or see it at
all, think again.

In fact, I'm not on a _single_ mailing list, and I'm not going to be. I
see some of the mailing lists (most notably linux-kernel) through a news
gateway, but..

In short - if people have valid MM work that they want to be considered
for the standard kernel too, DON'T USE LINUX-MM.
