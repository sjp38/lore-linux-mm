6b101e2a3ce4 ("mm/CMA: fix boot regression due to physical address of
high_memory") added checks to use __pa_nodebug on x86 since
CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL complains about high_memory not being linearlly
mapped. arm64 is now getting support for CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL as well.
Rather than add an explosion of arches to the #ifdef, switch to an
alternate method to calculate the physical start of highmem using
the page before highmem starts. This avoids the need for the #ifdef and
extra __pa_nodebug calls.
