Okay. I have to agree with the author that, in such a situation, it wouldn't 
help. However there are, without a doubt, other situations where it would 
help immensely. (memory hogs forcing everything to disk and quitting, one off 
tasks that don't balloon the cache (kernel compiles, et al) - in those 
situations swap prefetch would really shine.)
