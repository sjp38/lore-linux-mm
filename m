I followed what you suggested and add gfpflags_allow_writeback that
tests against the __GFP_IO flag:

static inline bool gfpflags_allow_writeback(const gfp_t gfp_flags)
{
	return !!(gfp_flags & __GFP_IO);
}

And then not to go for CMA in the case of writeback in function
__dma_alloc:

-	cma = allowblock ? dev_get_cma_area(dev) : false;
+	allowwriteback = gfpflags_allow_writeback(gfp);
+	cma = (allowblock && !allowwriteback) ? dev_get_cma_area(dev) : false;

This workaround fixes the issue I faced (I have prepared a patch).

I have also removed the mutex (start_isolate_page_range retunrs -EBUSY),
and it worked (in my case).

But I did not do the proper magic because I am not sure of what should
be done and how: -EBUSY is not handled and __GFP_NOIO is not honored.
