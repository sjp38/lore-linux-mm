No, the profiles all came from steady state. The profiles from the
initial startup phase hammer the mmap_sem because of page fault vs
mprotect contention (glibc runs mprotect() on every chunk of
memory it allocates). It's not until the cache reaches "full" and it
starts recycling old buffers rather than allocating new ones that
the tlb flush problem dominates the profiles.

Yup, will do. might take an hour or two before I get to it, though...
