<p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot take action on the mail you sent us because it does not reference a Hotmail account. Please send us another message that contains the full Hotmail e-mail address and the full e-mail message to:
<p>    abuse@hotmail.com
<p>
<p>>>> To forward mail with full headers
<p>
<p>Using Hotmail:
<p>1.  Click "Options" to the right of the "Contacts" tab. The "Options" page appears.
<p>2.  Under "Additional Options", click "Mail Display Settings". The "Mail Display Settings" page appears.
<p>3.  Under "Message Headers", select "Full" and click "OK".
<p>4.  Forward the resulting mail to:
<p>       abuse@hotmail.com
<p>
<p>Using MSN Explorer:
<p>1.  Open the message, and then click "More" in the upper right corner.
<p>2.  Click "Message Source". The message opens in a new window with all the header information visible.
<p>3.  Copy all the text and paste it into a new message. Send this message to:
<p>       abuse@msn.com
<p>
<p>Using Outlook Express or Outlook:
<p>1.  On the unopened mail, place your cursor over the mail, right-click, and click "Options".
<p>2.  Under "Internet headers", copy the contents of the full header.
<p>3.  Open the e-mail in question and forward a complete copy of the message, including the full message header you copied at the beginning of your message, to:
<p>      abuse@hotmail.com
<p>
<p>If you're not a Hotmail member, consult the Help associated with your e-mail program to determine how to view complete header information. Then forward the message to:
<p>    abuse@hotmail.com
<p>
<p>If the unsolicited junk e-mail or "spam" comes from a non-Hotmail account, you can send a complaint to the service provider that sent the mail. Make sure that you include full headers when you send your complaint. 
<p>
<p>In the full header, look at the last "Received" notation to locate what .com domain it came from. It looks something like:
<p>    [service provider domain name].com
<p>
<p>Forward a complete copy of the message, including the full message header, to:
<p>      abuse@[service provider domain name].com
<p>
<p>If the domain does not have an abuse service, forward your complaint to:
<p>      webmaster@[service provider domain name].com
<p>
<p>All Hotmail customers have agreed to MSN Website Terms of Use and Notices(TOU) that forbid e-mail abuse. At the bottom of any page in Hotmail, click "Terms of Use" to view the Terms of Use document in its entirety.
