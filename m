Hi,

Just a reminder to everyone that the deadline for suggesting discussion
topics (and for requesting attendance) at the LSF/MM 2011 is next Monday
6th of February.

We will start sending out invitations this week to ensure that those of
you who need visas have enough time to apply. Please do send a note to
lsf-pc@lists.linuxfoundation.org if you require a formal letter of
invitation in order to apply for a US visa.

Cheers,
   Trond Myklebust (on behalf of the program committee)

The annual Linux Storage, Filesystem and Memory Management Workshop for
2011 will be held on the 2 days preceding the Linux Foundation
Collaboration Summit at Hotel Kabuki in the Japantown area of San
Francisco:

   http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/collaboration-summit

Given the success of last year's 3 track experiment, we are once again
planning to hold some joint sessions and the rest split into separate
Storage, Filesystem and Memory Management breakout sessions. We'd
therefore like to issue a call for agenda proposals that are suitable
for cross-track discussion as well as more technical subjects for
discussion in the breakout sessions.

Suggestions for agenda topics should be sent before February 6th to

lsf-pc@lists.linuxfoundation.org

and optionally cc the Linux list which would be most interested in it:

SCSI: linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org
FS: linux-fsdevel@vger.kernel.org
MM: linux-mm@kvack.org

Please remember to tag your subject with [LSF/MM TOPIC] to make it
easier to track. Agenda topics and attendees will be selected by the
programme committee, but the final agenda will be by formed by consensus
of the attendees on the day.

We'll try to cap attendance at around 25-30 per track to facilitate
discussions although the final numbers will depend on the room sizes at
the venue.

Requests to attend should be sent to:

lsf-pc@lists.linuxfoundation.org

please summarize what expertise you will bring to the meeting, and what
you'd like to discuss.  please also tag your email with [ATTEND] so
there's less chance of it getting lost in the large mail pile.

Presentations are allowed to guide discussion, but are strongly
discouraged.  There will be no recording or audio bridge, however
written minutes will be published as in previous years:

If you have feedback on last year's meeting that we can use to improve
this year's, please also send that to:

lsf-pc@lists.linuxfoundation.org

On behalf of the Program Committee, Thanks,
