Sigh.  Please do promise to spend a minimum of 45 seconds thinking up and
typing in nice, meaningful patch titles?  It's a little thing, but this
stuff is forever.

Also, please expunge akpm@linuxfoundation.org from any address book in
which he might appear.  That rewriting was a transient brainfart by the
linux-foundation.org admins for half a day a few weeks back and it is
hanging around like its non-brain namesake in a small room, causing me
to get duplicate emails, send emails to myself, etc.

Thanks.
