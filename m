CHINA GOLD CORP
Symbol: CGDC
Current Price: 0.25

A Company engaged in gold and minerals exploration and development of 
gold and mineral properties in China. 

Why consider CHINA GOLD CORP (CGDC)? Seee n0wadays what happened.

? Rising gold prices are further accelerating this gold rush - The 
price of gold has up 250% over the past five years, and this is still only 
a quarter of when the price peaked 25 years ago. (Adjusted for 
inflation.)

? HUGE gold discovery in southwestern China - Resources have already 
been estimated by analysts at 14 million ounces...and the number keeps 
climbing.

? China is the world?s last great under-explored land-mass - Locked 
away in a Marxist time-warp with limited exploration technology, China?s 
rich virgin gold fields have been overlooked and ignored until recently.

? China is already the world?s 4th largest producer of gold ? and will 
soon be the world?s #1 producer AND #1 consumer. The country is going 
gold-crazy!

? Foreign gold companies are now welcome - and the laws have been 
changed to provide full legal protection.

You can see China?s developing gold boom is building momentum. Rare 
0pp0rtunity for early investors!!
