Minimally, there is still the window where we clear the PTE to set the
protections. During that window, a fault can occur. In the old code which
was inherently racy and unsafe, the fault might still go ahead deferring
a potential migration for a short period. In the current code, it'll stall
on the lock, notice the PTE is changed and refault so the overhead is very
different but functionally correct.

In the old code, pte_write had complex interactions with background
cleaning and sync in the case of file mappings (not applicable to Dave's
case but still it's unpredictable behaviour). pte_dirty is close but there
are interactions with the application as the timing of writes vs the PTE
scanner matter.

Even if we restored the original behaviour, it would still be very difficult
to understand all the interactions between userspace and kernel.  The patch
below should be tested because it's clearer what the intent is. Using
the VMA flags is coarse but it's not vulnerable to timing artifacts that
behave differently depending on the machine. My preliminary testing shows
it helps but not by much. It does not restore performance to where it was
but it's easier to understand which is important if there are changes in
the scheduler later.

In combination, I also think that slowing PTE scanning when migration fails
is the correct action even if it is unrelated to the patch Dave bisected
to. It's stupid to increase scanning rates and incurs more faults when
migrations are failing so I'll be testing that next.
