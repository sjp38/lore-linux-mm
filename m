=2E..sorry for the reply to myself.

As Gentoo user i'm happy about the freedom of choice in almost every aspect=
 of=20
the system.
But with the kernel this freedom is taken away and i'm left with largely=20
choices other people did. Sure, i can get the sources and patch and change=
=20
the kernel myself in every aspect but thats more the possibility given by t=
he=20
freedom of the open source of the kernel.
I think the kernel should be more open for new ideas, and as long as the=20
maintainer follows the kernel development things can be left in, if the=20
maintainer can't follow anymore they are taken out quite fast again. (This=
=20
statement mostly counts for parts of the kernel where a choice is possible =
or=20
the coding overhead of making such choice possible is quite low.)
A problem of Linux is there are 100s of patches and patchsets out there but=
 if=20
you want to have more than one (since they offer advantages or functionalit=
y=20
in different places) you are mostly left alone, start to integrate all=20
patches by hand and solve so many rejects.

=2E.still a happy CK user, but sad that Con left the scene.

Dirk.
