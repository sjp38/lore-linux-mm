Hi Andi, 

Seems I used a stale email address of you from a related git commit log,
so this is a resend, sorry.

Hi, 

I notice that all x86 assembly code for string operations containing
"scasb, lodsb", etc does not have "cld" at the beginning.
Is this 100% safe? 
Or in other words, how could we be sure that
there is no "std" generated by compiler somewhere just before
the string operations? 


Thanks,

Nai
