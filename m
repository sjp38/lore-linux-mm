AGP is a gigantic nightmare :-) It's not just cache coherency issues
(some implementations are coherent, some aren't, Apple's is ... weird).

Apple has all sort of bugs, and Darwin source code only sheds light on
some of them. Some implementation can only read, not write I think, for
example. There are issues with transfers crossing some boundaries I
beleive, but it's all unclear.

Apple makes this work with a combination of hacks in the AGP "driver"
and the closed source GPU driver, which we don't see.

I have given up trying to make that stuff work reliably a decade ago :)

Cheers,
Ben.
