Hi all,

	There was a discussion about the current benchmarking tools being
not suitable or sufficient for testing the performance of the Linux VMs.
I am interested in writing one and would like to have your opinions on
the matter. I would like to know what is missing in the current set of
tools (lmbench, dbench..) and what is required. 


					Bye,
						Abhi.
