Hi Haiyan,

Thanks a lot for sharing this perf reports.

I looked at them closely, and I've to admit that I was not able to found a
major difference between the base and the head report, except that
handle_pte_fault() is no more in-lined in the head one.

As expected, __handle_speculative_fault() is never traced since these tests are
dealing with file mapping, not handled in the speculative way.

When running these test did you seen a major differences in the test's result
between base and head ?

>From the number of cycles counted, the biggest difference is page_fault3 when
run with the THP enabled:
				BASE		HEAD		Delta
page_fault2_base_thp_never	1142252426747	1065866197589	-6.69%
page_fault2_base_THP-Alwasys	1124844374523	1076312228927	-4.31%
page_fault3_base_thp_never	1099387298152	1134118402345	3.16%
page_fault3_base_THP-Always	1059370178101	853985561949	-19.39%


The very weird thing is the difference of the delta cycles reported between
thp never and thp always, because the speculative way is aborted when checking
for the vma->ops field, which is the same in both case, and the thp is never
checked. So there is no code covering differnce, on the speculative path,
between these 2 cases. This leads me to think that there are other interactions
interfering in the measure.

Looking at the perf-profile_page_fault3_*_THP-Always, the major differences at
the head of the perf report is the 92% testcase which is weirdly not reported
on the head side :
    92.02%    22.33%  page_fault3_processes  [.] testcase
92.02% testcase

Then the base reported 37.67% for __do_page_fault() where the head reported
48.41%, but the only difference in this function, between base and head, is the
call to handle_speculative_fault(). But this is a macro checking for the fault
flags, and mm->users and then calling __handle_speculative_fault() if needed.
So this can't explain this difference, except if __handle_speculative_fault()
is inlined in __do_page_fault().
Is this the case on your build ?

Haiyan, do you still have the output of the test to check those numbers too ?

Cheers,
Laurent

>>>>>>> Subject: [PATCH v11 00/26] Speculative page faults
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> This is a port on kernel 4.17 of the work done by Peter Zijlstra to handle
>>>>>>> page fault without holding the mm semaphore [1].
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> The idea is to try to handle user space page faults without holding the
>>>>>>> mmap_sem. This should allow better concurrency for massively threaded
>>>>>>> process since the page fault handler will not wait for other threads memory
>>>>>>> layout change to be done, assuming that this change is done in another part
>>>>>>> of the process's memory space. This type page fault is named speculative
>>>>>>> page fault. If the speculative page fault fails because of a concurrency is
>>>>>>> detected or because underlying PMD or PTE tables are not yet allocating, it
>>>>>>> is failing its processing and a classic page fault is then tried.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> The speculative page fault (SPF) has to look for the VMA matching the fault
>>>>>>> address without holding the mmap_sem, this is done by introducing a rwlock
>>>>>>> which protects the access to the mm_rb tree. Previously this was done using
>>>>>>> SRCU but it was introducing a lot of scheduling to process the VMA's
>>>>>>> freeing operation which was hitting the performance by 20% as reported by
>>>>>>> Kemi Wang [2]. Using a rwlock to protect access to the mm_rb tree is
>>>>>>> limiting the locking contention to these operations which are expected to
>>>>>>> be in a O(log n) order. In addition to ensure that the VMA is not freed in
>>>>>>> our back a reference count is added and 2 services (get_vma() and
>>>>>>> put_vma()) are introduced to handle the reference count. Once a VMA is
>>>>>>> fetched from the RB tree using get_vma(), it must be later freed using
>>>>>>> put_vma(). I can't see anymore the overhead I got while will-it-scale
>>>>>>> benchmark anymore.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> The VMA's attributes checked during the speculative page fault processing
>>>>>>> have to be protected against parallel changes. This is done by using a per
>>>>>>> VMA sequence lock. This sequence lock allows the speculative page fault
>>>>>>> handler to fast check for parallel changes in progress and to abort the
>>>>>>> speculative page fault in that case.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> Once the VMA has been found, the speculative page fault handler would check
>>>>>>> for the VMA's attributes to verify that the page fault has to be handled
>>>>>>> correctly or not. Thus, the VMA is protected through a sequence lock which
>>>>>>> allows fast detection of concurrent VMA changes. If such a change is
>>>>>>> detected, the speculative page fault is aborted and a *classic* page fault
>>>>>>> is tried.  VMA sequence lockings are added when VMA attributes which are
>>>>>>> checked during the page fault are modified.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> When the PTE is fetched, the VMA is checked to see if it has been changed,
>>>>>>> so once the page table is locked, the VMA is valid, so any other changes
>>>>>>> leading to touching this PTE will need to lock the page table, so no
>>>>>>> parallel change is possible at this time.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> The locking of the PTE is done with interrupts disabled, this allows
>>>>>>> checking for the PMD to ensure that there is not an ongoing collapsing
>>>>>>> operation. Since khugepaged is firstly set the PMD to pmd_none and then is
>>>>>>> waiting for the other CPU to have caught the IPI interrupt, if the pmd is
>>>>>>> valid at the time the PTE is locked, we have the guarantee that the
>>>>>>> collapsing operation will have to wait on the PTE lock to move forward.
>>>>>>> This allows the SPF handler to map the PTE safely. If the PMD value is
>>>>>>> different from the one recorded at the beginning of the SPF operation, the
>>>>>>> classic page fault handler will be called to handle the operation while
>>>>>>> holding the mmap_sem. As the PTE lock is done with the interrupts disabled,
>>>>>>> the lock is done using spin_trylock() to avoid dead lock when handling a
>>>>>>> page fault while a TLB invalidate is requested by another CPU holding the
>>>>>>> PTE.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> In pseudo code, this could be seen as:
>>>>>>>     speculative_page_fault()
>>>>>>>     {
>>>>>>>             vma = get_vma()
>>>>>>>             check vma sequence count
>>>>>>>             check vma's support
>>>>>>>             disable interrupt
>>>>>>>                   check pgd,p4d,...,pte
>>>>>>>                   save pmd and pte in vmf
>>>>>>>                   save vma sequence counter in vmf
>>>>>>>             enable interrupt
>>>>>>>             check vma sequence count
>>>>>>>             handle_pte_fault(vma)
>>>>>>>                     ..
>>>>>>>                     page = alloc_page()
>>>>>>>                     pte_map_lock()
>>>>>>>                             disable interrupt
>>>>>>>                                     abort if sequence counter has changed
>>>>>>>                                     abort if pmd or pte has changed

>>>>>>>                     ...
>>>>>>>     }
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>     arch_fault_handler()
>>>>>>>     {
>>>>>>>             if (speculative_page_fault(&vma))
>>>>>>>                goto done
>>>>>>>     again:
>>>>>>>             lock(mmap_sem)
>>>>>>>             vma = find_vma();

>>>>>>>                unlock(mmap_sem)
>>>>>>>                goto again;
>>>>>>>     done:
>>>>>>>             handle fault error
>>>>>>>     }
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> Support for THP is not done because when checking for the PMD, we can be
>>>>>>> confused by an in progress collapsing operation done by khugepaged. The
>>>>>>> issue is that pmd_none() could be true either if the PMD is not already
>>>>>>> populated or if the underlying PTE are in the way to be collapsed. So we
>>>>>>> cannot safely allocate a PMD if pmd_none() is true.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> This series add a new software performance event named 'speculative-faults'
>>>>>>> or 'spf'. It counts the number of successful page fault event handled
>>>>>>> speculatively. When recording 'faults,spf' events, the faults one is
>>>>>>> counting the total number of page fault events while 'spf' is only counting
>>>>>>> the part of the faults processed speculatively.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> There are some trace events introduced by this series. They allow
>>>>>>> identifying why the page faults were not processed speculatively. This
>>>>>>> doesn't take in account the faults generated by a monothreaded process
>>>>>>> which directly processed while holding the mmap_sem. This trace events are
>>>>>>> grouped in a system named 'pagefault', they are:
>>>>>>>  - pagefault:spf_vma_changed : if the VMA has been changed in our back
>>>>>>>  - pagefault:spf_vma_noanon : the vma->anon_vma field was not yet set.
>>>>>>>  - pagefault:spf_vma_notsup : the VMA's type is not supported
>>>>>>>  - pagefault:spf_vma_access : the VMA's access right are not respected
>>>>>>>  - pagefault:spf_pmd_changed : the upper PMD pointer has changed in our
>>>>>>>    back.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> To record all the related events, the easier is to run perf with the
>>>>>>> following arguments :
>>>>>>> $ perf stat -e 'faults,spf,pagefault:*' <command>
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> There is also a dedicated vmstat counter showing the number of successful
>>>>>>> page fault handled speculatively. I can be seen this way:
>>>>>>> $ grep speculative_pgfault /proc/vmstat
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> This series builds on top of v4.16-mmotm-2018-04-13-17-28 and is functional
>>>>>>> on x86, PowerPC and arm64.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> ---------------------
>>>>>>> Real Workload results
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> As mentioned in previous email, we did non official runs using a "popular
>>>>>>> in memory multithreaded database product" on 176 cores SMT8 Power system
>>>>>>> which showed a 30% improvements in the number of transaction processed per
>>>>>>> second. This run has been done on the v6 series, but changes introduced in
>>>>>>> this new version should not impact the performance boost seen.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> Here are the perf data captured during 2 of these runs on top of the v8
>>>>>>> series:

>>>>>>> ------------------
>>>>>>> Changes since v10 (https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/4/17/572):
>>>>>>>  - Accounted for all review feedbacks from Punit Agrawal, Ganesh Mahendran
>>>>>>>    and Minchan Kim, hopefully.
>>>>>>>  - Remove unneeded check on CONFIG_SPECULATIVE_PAGE_FAULT in
>>>>>>>    __do_page_fault().
>>>>>>>  - Loop in pte_spinlock() and pte_map_lock() when pte try lock fails
>>>>>>>    instead
>>>>>>>    of aborting the speculative page fault handling. Dropping the now
>>>>>>> useless
>>>>>>>    trace event pagefault:spf_pte_lock.
>>>>>>>  - No more try to reuse the fetched VMA during the speculative page fault
>>>>>>>    handling when retrying is needed. This adds a lot of complexity and
>>>>>>>    additional tests done didn't show a significant performance improvement.
>>>>>>>  - Convert IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_NUMA) back to #ifdef due to build error.
