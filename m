I get in 1:08pm local time on Sunday.  I'd be game to coordinate if possible,
but it may be too late for that.

FWIW I spoke with http://canyontransport.com and although the website says
minimum 2 adults, they will actually take just one, so you don't /have/ to
find another just to book with them.  The price is per-person regardless
of how many are in the van.
