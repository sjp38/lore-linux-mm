Please note that we are using a different way of selecting who will get
invites this year; please read below, subscribe to the
ksummit-2012-discuss mailing list, and send an [ATTEND] request to the
mailing list if you are interested in attending.

Do feel free to forward this other mailing lists (especially if there
are internal kernel development lists at your company) if appropriate.

Many thanks,

The annual Kernel Summit for 2012 will be held on the 3 days preceding the
Linux Foundation LinuxCon and Linux Plumbers Conference at the Sheraton San
Diego Hotel and Marina from 27-29 August:

        http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/2012/
        https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon

The format of the Kernel Summit will be

Monday: All Kernel Developers Plenary Sessions
Tuesday: Kernel technical working and breakout sessions
Wednesday: Additional Technical sessions shared with Plumbers


This year, in order to make the selection process more transparent,
we're trying a new mechanism where we'll be selecting this year's
attendees from amongst those who submit proposals to attend as
described below.

We'll try to cap attendance at around 80-100 for the all kernel
developers day, so get your request in early.  To request a place to
attend, please send an email to

    ksummit-2012-discuss@lists.linuxfoundation.org

Please summarize what expertise you will bring to the meeting,
and what you'd like to discuss.  Please also tag your email with
[ATTEND] so there's less chance of it getting lost in the large
mail pile.

Requests to attend will be looked upon more favorably if you also
participate in the discussion of topics at

    ksummit-2012-discuss@lists.linuxfoundation.org

You can subscribe via mailman:
