It seem's that if the limit is reached now the new try_to_free_pages
instead of the old try_to_free_page(without s) function may free some
more pages as requested ... in best case SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX pages are
freed at once ... looks good Linus.  Together with the increased
count_max and count_min in shrink_mmap this one really makes sense.

The change in fs/dcache.c does not look very well because
as higher the number given to prune_dache in shrink_dcache_memory
as more the dcache is pruned ... `0' isn't that good is it?

PS: I've updated my lowmem.patch to 2.1.110. I would like to
    hear some comments on it ... for more please see
