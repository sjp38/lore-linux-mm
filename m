This is why in that case (if the contention was generated by the
lru_lock) we would be better off to go ahead and do migrate_pages.

We could track contended_lru_lock and contended_zone_lock separately
to know if it's that case or not, but then I doubt it matters that much.

If you prefer the putback_lru_pages I'm fine, I only wanted to clarify
neither of the two solutions is going to do the optimal thing at all
times.
