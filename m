Hi,

Is there anywhere that documents the current problems that Linux is 
having with memory management.
Are there any "big" problems still outstanding, or is it just a matter 
of fixing edge cases now?
The last time I looked into this, people were having memory pressure 
problems relating to network attached swap space. I believe those 
problems are fixed now and I was able to help there.

Kind Regards

James
