But why would you want to create that many vmas? If you're going to call
sys_numa_mbind() at object level you're doing it wrong.=20

Typical usage would be to call it on the chunks your allocator asks from
the system. Depending on how your application decomposes this is per
thread or per thread-pool.

But again, who is writing such large threaded apps. The shared address
space thing is cute, but the shared address space thing is also the
bottleneck. Sharing mmap_sem et al across the entire machine has been
enough reason not to use threads for plenty people.
