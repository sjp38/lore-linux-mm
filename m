How common are nontrivial patterns on real hardware?  This would be
interesting to hear from Google or another large user.

If so, we should probably introduce this as another linked-list data
structure; we can allow it to be preprocessed from the command line if
need be.

I have to say I think Google's point that truncating the list is
unacceptable... that would mean running in a known-bad configuration,
and even a hard crash would be better.
