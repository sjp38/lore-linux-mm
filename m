I wouldn't call it a deadline, more a sort of guideline ... we only call
it a deadline because if we didn't some of the procrastinators out there
wouldn't submit anything until the day before the actual summit. We do
do the first cut of invites and topics on 6 Feb, but we keep some slots
open all the way up to the summit just in case something important comes
along.
