Well it says kernel summit is 4-6th, but also that it is a two
day event, so I think you're right that it starts on 5th.

I'd like to see what people's preferences are, whether we try to
do this on the 4th, or after KS (which could be 7th or 8th)? I
know some can't make it before KS and some can't make it after,
but if you absolutely won't come on any of these dates can you let
me know? And let me know preferences or other ideas too.

Regarding numbers, there are about a dozen so far which is good
but not as many filesystem maintainers as I had hoped (do they
tend not to get invited to KS?). We may get a few more people yet
so I think if we try to get a room to fit 20-25 people it would
be ideal: I don't want to turn anyone away ;)

Thanks,
Nick
