GET PAID to SURF the WEB!! 

Paid-To-Surf is an advertising agency that pay you to place a 
small banner on your screen while you surf the web. 
They pay you around .50 an hour. 
Although this doesn't sound like much, it comes out to about $20 
a month for most users. This could easily pay for your internet 
access. 
It gets better...

Most of these companies will also pay you a portion
of the amount that people you refer to them make.
For example: Paid-to-surf pays you .10 for every hour your
referrals surfs. So, if you sign up 100 people you would make
an extra $400 a month. 
It gets better! 

This company also pay you for people that your referrals sign up.
For example: If you signed up 100 people, and each of the people
you signed up sign up 100 people, you would make an extra $600 a 
month!
