Actually, I added those for --cc (checked in command history). I think 
problems went from mail server, it first sent 10 first patches, then no 
more, after 20 min I resented patches from 11, but after few hours some 
"not sent" patches were sent (I putted self to cc, so I know). Now, I 
see those at http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-ext4/.

Really sorry I haven't suppose of such behavior.

Radek
