Hey all,

Okay, I'm back in Toronto from sunny California, and I'm wondering if
someone would be so kind as to enlighten me about the current state of mm
in 2.1/plans for 2.3... I haven't really had time to pay attention lately,
but I'll be making some time in the next couple of weeks to tinker with
things, so: requests? =)

linux-kernel to sift for interesting bug/state reports)
