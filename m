Subject: What does pkmap stand for?

Really stupid question I know. I'm writing the chapter on high memory
management and so far it is making perfect sense except I can't find what
pkmap or kmap stands for. I'm guessing kmap means Kernel Map but pkmap
could be anything. current guesses are

Permanent Kernel Map
Page Kernel Map
PK Means Anything Pleasing

Extensive google and mailing list searching showed up nothing :-( . Any
help or plausible suggestions are welcome
