MR.SINE DITTA. 
AUDITING DEPARTMENT. 
INTERNATIONAL BANK OF AFRICA.(IBA)
(IBA HOUSE)VILLA 12 MADINA DAKAR,SENEGAL.


Attention,

I have a proposal for you,this however is not mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to honour against your will. I am 42 and working with a bank (one of the African leading bank in the West Coast). Here in this bank existed a dormant account for the past 8 years which belong to an American national who is now late MR.MAHAMED KAMAL YASSER.
 
When I discovered that there had been no deposits nor withdrawals from this account for this long period, I decided to carry out a system investigation and discovered that non of the family members nor relations of the late person is aware of this account. 

This is the update in a nutshell. 

Now I want an account overseas where the bank will transfer this funds.Thereafter, I had planned to destroy all related documents for this account. It is a careful network and for the past eleven months I have worked out everything to ensure a hitch-free operation. 

The amount is not so much at the moment and plus all the accumulated interest the balance in this account stands at-(US$ 6.5 million US Dollars Only). 

Now my questions are:- 
1. Can you handle this project confidently? 
2. Can I give you this trust? 
3. What will be your commission? If you can sponsor this transfer.
4. How much will be paid as TAx to your Government when confirm? 

Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible. 

Finally, it is our humble prayer that the information as contained herein be accorded the necessary attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves. 

I Expect your urgent response if you can handle this project. call or send a mail of confirmation to sineditta@myway.com

Respectfully yours, 
Mr.Sine Ditta.
AUDITOR.
