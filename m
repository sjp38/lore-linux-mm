It sure seems like this was a roughly fair comparison by friendlies,
as opposed to a de fecto, closed-source, self-perpetuating propoganda
machine out to steam roll possible competition.  Seems like it should
be responded to in the spirit of open source:  COOL!  So what was
broken in Linux/BSD and what technology did BSD/Linux use to fix it
that we can share?

End result could be to make them both better than any closed, proprietary,
over-large corporate product offering.

And, keep in mind that comparisons usually indicate that there are some
flaws - even if the flaw is that the user's weren't able to set up a
system that worked for them.  The key is to find and fix the flaws as
they are exposed.

Just my $0.03.
