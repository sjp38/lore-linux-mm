I was merely making sure what your intentions were regarding the
patches. And it's clear you have utter disregard for them, and security
as a whole. In your idea of the world 'there are no secrets'.

Good luck with that.

I submitted them so other people could benefit from it. In the end I
could care less about what you do with them, or if they are merged.
Now that is clear that trying to do so is a waste of time and energy,
I'm free to go with a clean conscience, knowing that these patches
didn't help others because I didn't try to, but because some council of
vagueness decided it doesn't fit their particularly flawed view of the
world.

See you in the next commit fixing a kernel vulnerability silently that
puts the infrastructure of several organizations at risk for your own
disregard.

	Larry.
