Temperature works for me.  Activity would also work, but it's not as 
strong on verb-support for me either - you can say "tired", 
"more/less activity", "asleep" but that's about it.  With temperature 
you can say "hot", "cold", "warmer", "cooler" and all sorts of things 
based around that - it even fits with the theorem that CMOS-based 
circuitry tend to warm up when actively in use.  I like it...
