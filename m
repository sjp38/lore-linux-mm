Hello all,

This is a heads up for anyone using email accounts @gmail.com or 
@googlemail.com: emails are being bounced intermittently for kvack.org 
mailing list messages, so you may not be receiving all messages sent to 
the list.  I've attempted to contact Google by way of the URL included 
in the SMTP response, but have not received any acknowledgement of the 
issue.  If anyone knows how to escalate the issue internally within 
Google, any help putting the right people onto the issue would be greatly 
appreciated.  Cheers,

		-ben
