We are going to use kthread_worker more widely and delayed works
will be pretty useful.

The implementation is inspired by workqueues. It uses a timer to
queue the work after the requested delay. If the delay is zero,
the work is queued immediately.

In compare with workqueues, each work is associated with a single
worker (kthread). Therefore the implementation could be much easier.
In particular, we use the worker->lock to synchronize all the
operations with the work. We do not need any atomic operation
with a flags variable.

In fact, we do not need any state variable at all. Instead, we
add a list of delayed works into the worker. Then the pending
work is listed either in the list of queued or delayed works.
And the existing check of pending works is the same even for
the delayed ones.

A work must not be assigned to another worker unless reinitialized.
Therefore the timer handler might expect that dwork->work->worker
is valid and it could simply take the lock. We just add some
sanity checks to help with debugging a potential misuse.
