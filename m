Revert 6527c2bdf1f833cc18e8f42bd97973d583e4aa83

This patch fixed the following bug:

  When prefaulting in the pages in generic_file_buffered_write(), we only
  faulted in the pages for the firts segment of the iovec.  If the second of
  successive segment described a mmapping of the page into which we're
  write()ing, and that page is not up-to-date, the fault handler tries to lock
  the already-locked page (to bring it up to date) and deadlocks.

  An exploit for this bug is in writev-deadlock-demo.c, in
  http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/ext3-tools.tar.gz.

  (These demos assume blocksize < PAGE_CACHE_SIZE).

The problem with this fix is that it takes the kernel back to doing a single
prepare_write()/commit_write() per iovec segment.  So in the worst case we'll
run prepare_write+commit_write 1024 times where we previously would have run
it once. The other problem with the fix is that it fix all the locking problems.


<insert numbers obtained via ext3-tools's writev-speed.c here>

And apparently this change killed NFS overwrite performance, because, I
suppose, it talks to the server for each prepare_write+commit_write.

So just back that patch out - we'll be fixing the deadlock by other means.

Nick says: also it only ever actually papered over the bug, because after
faulting in the pages, they might be unmapped or reclaimed.
