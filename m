Hi,

I'm wondering, what exactly _are_ our priorities for 2.2?

Apart from documentation, what else needs fixing and/or
tuning before 2.2 is out, who's working on what and which
jobs are left undone?

I know I'll be working on the documentation (HTMLizing
the Documentation/sysctl/* and writing a bit more) but
I can sure use some help...

I'm sure there are also other important things that need
help and even things that aren't done. Maybe it's time to
put our 2.3 projects aside for a while and focus on the
last bits of 2.2 readyness...

Rik.
