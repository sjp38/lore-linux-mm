Sorry for late.

I would like to attend LSF/MM this year; and most of all would like to
join Laura Abbott in his discussion of improving CMA.

I joined the develop works of CMA is not a long time after I joined the MI.
But to make it work good for our device.  I wrote a patch series to
improving CMA in https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/10/15/623.
I also used the patch series of Joonsoo in
https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/5/28/64.  And I wrote some patches around
it:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/12/25/47
https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/1/18/28
https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/1/18/33

Thanks,
Hui
