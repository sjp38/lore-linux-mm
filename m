@@ -108,6 +108,57 @@ UFFDIO_COPY. They're atomic as in guaranteeing that nothing can see an
 half copied page since it'll keep userfaulting until the copy has
 finished.
 
+Notes:
+
+- If you requested UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_MISSING when registering then
+  you must provide some kind of page in your thread after reading from
+  the uffd.  You must provide either UFFDIO_COPY or UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE.
+  The normal behavior of the OS automatically providing a zero page on
+  an annonymous mmaping is not in place.
+
+- None of the page-delivering ioctls default to the range that you
+  registered with.  You must fill in all fields for the appropriate
+  ioctl struct including the range.
+
+- You get the address of the access that triggered the missing page
+  event out of a struct uffd_msg that you read in the thread from the
+  uffd.  You can supply as many pages as you want with UFFDIO_COPY or
+  UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE.  Keep in mind that unless you used DONTWAKE then
+  the first of any of those IOCTLs wakes up the faulting thread.
+
+- Be sure to test for all errors including (pollfd[0].revents &
+  POLLERR).  This can happen, e.g. when ranges supplied were
+  incorrect.
+
+Write Protect Notifications
+---------------------------
+
+This is equivalent to (but faster than) using mprotect and a SIGSEGV
+signal handler.
+
+Firstly you need to register a range with UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_WP.
+Instead of using mprotect(2) you use ioctl(uffd, UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT,
+struct *uffdio_writeprotect) while mode = UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT_MODE_WP
+in the struct passed in.  The range does not default to and does not
+have to be identical to the range you registered with.  You can write
+protect as many ranges as you like (inside the registered range).
+Then, in the thread reading from uffd the struct will have
+msg.arg.pagefault.flags & UFFD_PAGEFAULT_FLAG_WP set. Now you send
+ioctl(uffd, UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT, struct *uffdio_writeprotect) again
+while pagefault.mode does not have UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT_MODE_WP set.
+This wakes up the thread which will continue to run with writes. This
+allows you to do the bookkeeping about the write in the uffd reading
+thread before the ioctl.
+
+If you registered with both UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_MISSING and
+UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_WP then you need to think about the sequence in
+which you supply a page and undo write protect.  Note that there is a
+difference between writes into a WP area and into a !WP area.  The
+former will have UFFD_PAGEFAULT_FLAG_WP set, the latter
+UFFD_PAGEFAULT_FLAG_WRITE.  The latter did not fail on protection but
+you still need to supply a page when UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_MISSING was
+used.
