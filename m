Kernel-janitors, sure.  :)

Just a couple of small points:

a.  I don't accept backporting patches.  2.4.x is mostly closed
	except for bug fixing.
b.  If you find something that you want to do, ask about it first
	on the kernel-janitors@lists.osdl.org mailing list, to make
	sure that it's still valid and that you won't be duplicating
	someone else's work.
c.  and the current URL is:  http://janitor.kernelnewbies.org/
