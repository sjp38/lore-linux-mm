HMM provides 3 separate types of functionality:
    - Mirroring: synchronize CPU page table and device page table
    - Device memory: allocating struct page for device memory
    - Migration: migrating regular memory to device memory

This patch introduces some common helpers and definitions to all of
those 3 functionality.

Changed since v2:
  - s/device unaddressable/device private
Changed since v1:
  - Kconfig logic (depend on x86-64 and use ARCH_HAS pattern)

+/*
+ * Heterogeneous Memory Management (HMM)
+ *
+ * See Documentation/vm/hmm.txt for reasons and overview of what HMM is and it
+ * is for. Here we focus on the HMM API description, with some explanation of
+ * the underlying implementation.
+ *
+ * Short description: HMM provides a set of helpers to share a virtual address
+ * space between CPU and a device, so that the device can access any valid
+ * address of the process (while still obeying memory protection). HMM also
+ * provides helpers to migrate process memory to device memory, and back. Each
+ * set of functionality (address space mirroring, and migration to and from
+ * device memory) can be used independently of the other.
+ *
+ *
+ * HMM address space mirroring API:
+ *
+ * Use HMM address space mirroring if you want to mirror range of the CPU page
+ * table of a process into a device page table. Here, "mirror" means "keep
+ * synchronized". Prerequisites: the device must provide the ability to write-
+ * protect its page tables (at PAGE_SIZE granularity), and must be able to
+ * recover from the resulting potential page faults.
+ *
+ * HMM guarantees that at any point in time, a given virtual address points to
+ * either the same memory in both CPU and device page tables (that is: CPU and
+ * device page tables each point to the same pages), or that one page table (CPU
+ * or device) points to no entry, while the other still points to the old page
+ * for the address. The latter case happens when the CPU page table update
+ * happens first, and then the update is mirrored over to the device page table.
+ * This does not cause any issue, because the CPU page table cannot start
+ * pointing to a new page until the device page table is invalidated.
+ *
+ * HMM uses mmu_notifiers to monitor the CPU page tables, and forwards any
+ * updates to each device driver that has registered a mirror. It also provides
+ * some API calls to help with taking a snapshot of the CPU page table, and to
+ * synchronize with any updates that might happen concurrently.
+ *
+ *
+ * HMM migration to and from device memory:
+ *
+ * HMM provides a set of helpers to hotplug device memory as ZONE_DEVICE, with
+ * a new MEMORY_DEVICE_PRIVATE type. This provides a struct page for each page
+ * of the device memory, and allows the device driver to manage its memory
+ * using those struct pages. Having struct pages for device memory makes
+ * migration easier. Because that memory is not addressable by the CPU it must
+ * never be pinned to the device; in other words, any CPU page fault can always
+ * cause the device memory to be migrated (copied/moved) back to regular memory.
+ *
+ * A new migrate helper (migrate_vma()) has been added (see mm/migrate.c) that
+ * allows use of a device DMA engine to perform the copy operation between
+ * regular system memory and device memory.
