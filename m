Fair enough, I have a Dell PowerEdge 6350 that I just ordered 6GB for, I'll use it as a test server for a bit, this machine is limited to 6GB so I'm sorry I cant test beyond that. If thier is any specific debug info anyone wants, let me know, and give instructions on how to obtain and I will be happy to supply such. Thanks again for the help.
