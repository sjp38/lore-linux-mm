Last time I tried that (getting rid of sc->may_swap, using
!swappiness), it was rejected it as there were users who relied on
swapping very slowly with this setting.

KOSAKI-san, do I remember correctly?  Do you still think it's an
issue?

Personally, I still think it's illogical that !swappiness allows
swapping and would love to see this patch go in.
