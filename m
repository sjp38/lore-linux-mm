Hi,

I'd like to continue attend the lsf/mm this year. I'm interested in
further steps about all memory compression projects, huge pages and page
cache replacement.

I was still working on zcache last year with the purpose making it a
second-level cache to improve the read performance and will consider use
some other memory devices(NVMe etc) as the second-level cache instead of
compression.
