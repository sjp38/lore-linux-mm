List-ID: <linux-mm.kvack.org>

Introduce a new type of mapping, VM_MIXEDMAP. This is unlike VM_PFNMAP in
that it can support COW mappings of arbitrary ranges including ranges without
struct page *and* ranges with a struct page that we actually want to refcount
(PFNMAP can only support COW in those cases where the un-COW-ed translations
are mapped linearly in the virtual address, and can only support non
refcounted ranges).

VM_MIXEDMAP achieves this by refcounting all pfn_valid pages, and not
refcounting !pfn_valid pages (which is not an option for VM_PFNMAP, because
it needs to avoid refcounting pfn_valid pages eg. for /dev/mem mappings).
