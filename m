I've been getting enough private mail about the trinity fuzz-tester that
there needs to be some coordination between people patching the same code etc.

To this end, there's now a mailing list..

Send a mail with 'subscribe trinity' in the body to majordomo@vger.kernel.org to subscribe.

My thanks to the folks at vger for hosting it, so I don't have to.

	Dave
