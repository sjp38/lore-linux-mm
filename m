Hi,
    I've been working on 'compressed cache' feature
(http://linuxcompressed.sourceforge.net/) for some time now. I'm
basically porting it to 2.6 kernel series as it has already been
developed for 2.4.x kernels.
   I'm wondering why this project is dead even when it showed great
performance improvement when system is under memory pressure.

Are there any serious drawbacks to this?
Do you think it will be of any use if ported to 2.6 kernel?

Your feedback will be really helpful.

Thanks
