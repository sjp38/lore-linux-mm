I thought it was intentional when you submitted a patch firstly.
"Kswapd makes sure zones include enough free pages(ie, include reserve
limit of above zones).
But you seem to see DMA zone can't meet above requirement forever in
some situation so that kswapd doesn't sleep.
Right?

Isn't it  better to use 0 instead of i?
