A particularly good example. I used to be able to just copy around the
driver for my host controller. Now I have to copy _two_ files, so the
world is going to end! Should I have insisted that we link libata
statically into each and every module which uses it?

(Or at least I have to copy two files _if_ I actually want to make
changes to libata.ko too, which I almost never do...)
