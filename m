mr:
  I am student in Chain ,and I am interesting in stadying " memory
management " about linux. but my knowleage on this is so poor that I can't
analyse it independently. therefor I am eager to get your help or that of
anyone else .
  I puzzled by some functions in directory of "mm" in linux kernel source .
I know it is a hard and mass work. and to it is too excessive 
requir. but I wish I can get your help.
