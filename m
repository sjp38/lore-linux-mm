Okay, so that is my Fig.2 case, and we don't have to worry about Fig.3.

One thing I forgot in Fig.1/2 which my original did have were to mark
the system MMU as optional.  (Think an ARM64 with SMMU into a 32-bit
peripheral bus.)  Do we support stacked MMUs in the DMA API?  We may
need to if we keep IOMMUs in the DMA API.
