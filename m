We're trying to use memory.high to limit workloads, but have found that
containment can frequently fail completely and cause OOM situations
outside of the cgroup. This happens especially with swap space -- either
when none is configured, or swap is full. These failures often also
don't have enough warning to allow one to react, whether for a human or
for a daemon monitoring PSI.

Here is output from a simple program showing how long it takes in Î¼sec
(column 2) to allocate a megabyte of anonymous memory (column 1) when a
cgroup is already beyond its memory high setting, and no swap is
available:

    [root@ktst ~]# systemd-run -p MemoryHigh=100M -p MemorySwapMax=1 \
    > --wait -t timeout 300 /root/mdf
    [...]

    [System OOM in 2-3 seconds]

The delay does go up extremely marginally past the 100MB memory.high
threshold, as now we spend time scanning before returning to usermode,
but it's nowhere near enough to contain growth. It also doesn't get
worse the more pages you have, since it only considers nr_pages.

The current situation goes against both the expectations of users of
memory.high, and our intentions as cgroup v2 developers. In
cgroup-v2.txt, we claim that we will throttle and only under "extreme
conditions" will memory.high protection be breached. Likewise, cgroup v2
users generally also expect that memory.high should throttle workloads
as they exceed their high threshold. However, as seen above, this isn't
always how it works in practice -- even on banal setups like those with
no swap, or where swap has become exhausted, we can end up with
memory.high being breached and us having no weapons left in our arsenal
to combat runaway growth with, since reclaim is futile.

It's also hard for system monitoring software or users to tell how bad
the situation is, as "high" events for the memcg may in some cases be
benign, and in others be catastrophic. The current status quo is that we
fail containment in a way that doesn't provide any advance warning that
things are about to go horribly wrong (for example, we are about to
invoke the kernel OOM killer).

This patch introduces explicit throttling when reclaim is failing to
keep memcg size contained at the memory.high setting. It does so by
applying an exponential delay curve derived from the memcg's overage
compared to memory.high.  In the normal case where the memcg is either
below or only marginally over its memory.high setting, no throttling
will be performed.

This composes well with system health monitoring and remediation, as
these allocator delays are factored into PSI's memory pressure
calculations. This both creates a mechanism system administrators or
applications consuming the PSI interface to trivially see that the memcg
in question is struggling and use that to make more reasonable
decisions, and permits them enough time to act. Either of these can act
with significantly more nuance than that we can provide using the system
OOM killer.

This is a similar idea to memory.oom_control in cgroup v1 which would
put the cgroup to sleep if the threshold was violated, but it's also
significantly improved as it results in visible memory pressure, and
also doesn't schedule indefinitely, which previously made tracing and
other introspection difficult (ie. it's clamped at 2*HZ per allocation
through MEMCG_MAX_HIGH_DELAY_JIFFIES).

Contrast the previous results with a kernel with this patch:

    [root@ktst ~]# systemd-run -p MemoryHigh=100M -p MemorySwapMax=1 \
    > --wait -t timeout 300 /root/mdf

    119 16383242
    120 16384979
    [...]

As you can see, in the normal case, memory allocation takes around 1000
Î¼sec. However, as we exceed our memory.high, things start to increase
exponentially, but fairly leniently at first. Our first megabyte over
memory.high takes us 0.16 seconds, then the next is 0.46 seconds, then
the next is almost an entire second. This gets worse until we reach our
eventual 2*HZ clamp per batch, resulting in 16 seconds per megabyte.
However, this is still making forward progress, so permits tracing or
further analysis with programs like GDB.

We use an exponential curve for our delay penalty for a few reasons:

1. We run mem_cgroup_handle_over_high to potentially do reclaim after
   we've already performed allocations, which means that temporarily
   going over memory.high by a small amount may be perfectly legitimate,
   even for compliant workloads. We don't want to unduly penalise such
   cases.
2. An exponential curve (as opposed to a static or linear delay) allows
   ramping up memory pressure stats more gradually, which can be useful
   to work out that you have set memory.high too low, without destroying
   application performance entirely.

This patch expands on earlier work by Johannes Weiner. Thanks!
