Subject: Documentation for the zone allocator?

I'd like to learn more about the zone allocator, but it appears to be so new
that it's not documented in any of my books, usenet, the mailing list, the
Documentation directory, or anywhere else I've searched.  Could someone either
point me to a description of it or just tell me what it is?

All I need is a one or two paragraph explanation of what it is and how it
works.  Pointers to white papers that talk about the overall theory of zones are
also appreciated.  Thanks!
