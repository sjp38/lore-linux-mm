Hi,

I just came to the linux-mm homepage at http://humbolt.geo.uu.nl/Linux-MM/
today to see what I could discover about the recent (past 6 months or so)
kernels' support for large memory.  You make oblique reference to the
Highmem changes and from those I was able to track down the story; but I
would have found it very useful if you had included the following two
links, which seem to basically summarize the high level (glossing over
current issues like the balancing):

	http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-mm/1999-11/msg00018.html

thanks.
