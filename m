Hello everybody
I am a linux newbie
I am using   below quoted linux version
 PCQlinux release 7.1
Kernel 2.4.2-2 on an i686
System is becoming slow after some user space  programs are run
and the memory usage displayed also increasing 
is their any known procedure or tools to study the memory leakage both in 
user-space and kernel-space        
Any suggestion is valuable
Thank you
