Hello there,
   I am doing a project "Network RAM" along with my for parteners. We are going to access a remote memory as if it were a local RAM. Traditional Network RAM projects actually form a remote "RAM Disk". What will be the benefits if we can add the remote memory in local address space? 
  Thanx in anticipation.
