I'm still new to this code, but isn't this saying that if a node has no
memory, then it shouldn't reclaim from any node? But, for a memoryless
node to ensure progress later if reclaim is necessary, it *must* reclaim
from other nodes? So wouldn't we want to set reclaim_nodes() in that
case to node_states[N_MEMORY]?

Nish
