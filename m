Subject: [PATCH V3] mm/thp: Split out pmd collpase flush into a separate functions
Date: Mon, 11 May 2015 12:09:30 +0530

Architectures like ppc64 [1] need to do special things while clearing
pmd before a collapse. For them this operation is largely different
from a normal hugepage pte clear. Hence add a separate function
to clear pmd before collapse. After this patch pmdp_* functions
operate only on hugepage pte, and not on regular pmd_t values
pointing to page table.

[1] ppc64 needs to invalidate all the normal page pte mappings we
already have inserted in the hardware hash page table. But before
doing that we need to make sure there are no parallel hash page
table insert going on. So we need to do a kick_all_cpus_sync()
before flushing the older hash table entries. By moving this to
a separate function we capture these details and mention how it
is different from a hugepage pte clear.

This patch is a cleanup and only does code movement for clarity.
There should not be any change in functionality.
