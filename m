In some areas FreeBSD is certainly better than Linux.
In other areas, Linux is better than FreeBSD.

At the moment both systems mostly seem to be on par
with each other and in some subsystems there's even a
friendly coopetition between the developers on both
OSes.

(and yes, I'm sure they can do better on MySQL benchmarks
than Linux at the moment ... but this is something we are
working on)
