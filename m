Efficient approach to investing from sttock professionals

Fellow Innvestor, big news are hitting on thursday for AGA O!!!

Somebody knows something...place A GAO on the radar!!!

Get ready for a volatile 2nd half of 2006 - one where the Bulls and 
Bears will BOTH be proved wrong. But odds are, we'll see another 
year where the makret indexes bounce around a lot without really going anywhere. And we'll also see certain sectors - favored at this point in the economic cycle - SOAR... 

Own the right sttocks, in the right space, and you could reap a 
handful of money-doublers. But if you own the wrong investment, you could easly lose 25%-35% or more! 

Here is my Favorite Pick for the second half of 2006: AGA O!!!

A drop of ink may make a million think. Common fame is seldom to blame. Jack of all trades, master of none Life begins at forty The trouble with experience is that by the time you have it, you are too old to take advantage of it A spy with flatulence will always blow his cover..

You can't teach an old dog new.. math. And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed..
