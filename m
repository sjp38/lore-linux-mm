You are right... I spent yesterday putting up my current box (mmx 166,
32 ram,300 hd) with 2.4.0-t9p2 and some other patches) and from 1 day
of work I can say that the new vm used less swap that the original
one, so in fact I though about going to the web page to get more info
about how it was progressing and what would be added next.

Ok, I can take it. Having a good free code without some sort of
documentation is just a big shame!

I'm going to the web site to have a look right now, but I don't know
exacly what to do on it, so please tell me, ok???
