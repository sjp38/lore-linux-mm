I'm not really seeing a description of the actual bug.  I don't know
what counter.sh is, there is no copy of counter.sh included in the
changelogs and there is no description of the kernel error which
counter.sh demonstrates.

So can you pleaser send to me a copy of counter.sh as well as a
suitable description of the kernel error which counter.sh triggers?
