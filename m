If you mean that putting the text "url" in front of a url was invented
by the deparment of redundancy department then yup.  But if the linux-mm
list sees a message starting with a url then it decides to hide it in
the mail headers.

If you mean something else then I don't know what it is.

(And I'm tool old and cynical to use this "URI" stuff)
