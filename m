 From : Abdulaih Abacha
 
  Re: Business proposal
 
  First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in
 this transaction
  . This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly
 confidential and top secrecy.
 
  I am Abdulaih Abacha a junior brother to late
 president of Nigeria
  General Sani- Abacha who died in 1998.
 
  However, there is a sum of US $28.35m ( Twenty eight
 point three
  five million dolars ) deposited in a security
 company. This fund
  being part of money left behind my late brother. This
said amount
  (US$28.35m) has been coded and secretly deposited in
 this security
  company ever since 1998before he died, and now
 declared as  FAMILY
  TREASURY and the documents and information regarding
 this said
 fund was entrusted to me by my late brother before
 his death.
 
  Now it has become pertinent for the family to move
 this money to
  a safe guarded account because the present Government
 under the
 leadership of president Olusegun Obasanjo has stepped
 up effort
 to arrest all the members of our family and to track
 all my brothers
  account and because of this we the members of
 Abachas family had
  been under hiding since they have arrested eldest son
 Mohammed Abacha
 whose now in prison . Now to avoid been arrested and
 therefore could
not come out openly to claim this fund. As a result,
services of
  foreign counterpart who could help stand as a
 claiming beneficiary
 to this said US$28.35m is needed, hence I am sending
this letter
  to you hoping that you will assist us.
 
  Awaiting your acceptance to assist we shall talk of
 Percentage that
 is what should be your own if you assist us. If you
 have any positive
  response towards my proposal, please contact me without delay on
 this above e-mail address to enable me give you full
details and
 also give you my data. I look forward to you ealier
 respond.

 Best Regards
 Abdulaih Abacha.
