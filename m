The annual Linux Storage, Filesystem and Memory Management Summit for
2013 will be held on April 18th and 19th following the Linux Foundation
Collaboration Summit at Parc 55 Hotel in San Francisco, CA:

	https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/collaboration-summit
	https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/lsfmm-summit

We'd therefore like to issue a call for agenda proposals that are
suitable for cross-track discussion as well as more technical subjects
for discussion in the breakout sessions.

1) Suggestions for agenda topics should be sent before February 8th
2013 to:

	lsf-pc@lists.linux-foundation.org

and optionally cc the Linux list which would be most interested in it:

	ATA: linux-ide@vger.kernel.org
	SCSI: linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org
	FS: linux-fsdevel@vger.kernel.org
	MM: linux-mm@kvack.org

Please remember to tag your subject with [LSF/MM TOPIC] to make it
easier to track. Agenda topics and attendees will be selected by the
program committee, but the final agenda will be formed by consensus of
the attendees on the day.

We'll try to cap attendance at around 25-30 per track to facilitate
discussions although the final numbers will depend on the room sizes at
the venue.

2) Requests to attend the summit should be sent to:

	lsf-pc@lists.linux-foundation.org

Please summarize what expertise you will bring to the meeting, and what
you'd like to discuss.  please also tag your email with [ATTEND] so
there's less chance of it getting lost in the large mail pile.

Presentations are allowed to guide discussion, but are strongly
discouraged. There will be no recording or audio bridge. However,
written minutes will be published as in previous years:

improve this year's, please also send that to:
