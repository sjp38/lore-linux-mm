It's official. Adobe has purchased Macromedia. They will now be a massive player in the publishing software industry, capable of competing with Microsoft. Is this what it takes? Fighting a humongous corporation with a mega company? It does make sense. Years of protest and boycotts by lefties, techies and generally disgruntled users have failed miserably in their quest to make Microsoft an insignificant (or even markedly less noticeable) market force. But it makes me sad - not one week after I'd just been so impressed by Adobe.3

Thanks, 

Dina Pena
