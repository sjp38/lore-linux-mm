Subject: linux-mm remailer eats [PATCH xx/yy] subject lines?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0606221141450.30988@schroedinger.engr.sgi.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Return-Path: <owner-linux-mm@kvack.org>
To: linux-mm@kvack.org
List-ID: <linux-mm.kvack.org>

We noticed that many of my emails to this list have the [PATCH ...] 
subject part removed from it. The mails to lkml arrive just fine. The cc 
that I am getting is also okay. Anyone have a clue?
