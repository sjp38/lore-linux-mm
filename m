I am sorry, but I wasn't online last week and was too busy the last few
weeks so I didn't get to follow up on the last two mmotm updates in
my tree.
The thing is more complicated by many conflicts with the cgroup tree
which seem to be not worth the hassle as the merge window should open
shortly. I will continue with the next major Linus' tree.

Sorry about that.
