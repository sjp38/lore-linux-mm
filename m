Hi webguy@marc.info --

IIUC, per the above, something apparently happened at marc.info
that caused your feed from linux-mm@kvack.org to be dropped
due to excessive bounces.  Could you please resubscribe as
http://marc.info/?l=3Dlinux-mm is widely documented as the
home of the linux-mm mailing list archives and you are now
missing almost six weeks of archives for the list.

I am just a user of marc.info... if you need to communicate
with the owner of linux-mm, I think that is Ben (cc'ed).

Thanks,
Dan
