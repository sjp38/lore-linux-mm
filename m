Hi,

I would like to attend LSF/MM summit. I'm interested in discussion about
huge pages, scalability of memory management subsystem and persistent
memory.

Last year I did some work to fix THP-related regressions and improve
scalability. I also work on THP for file-backed pages.

Depending on project status, I probably want to bring transparent huge
pagecache as a topic.
