I would like to attend LSF/MM summit. I'm interested in discussion about
huge pages, scalability of memory management subsystem related to
improved virtual machine density. I am also interested in discussion
around THP support for file backed pages.

In the past I have worked on Ext4 file system and also contributed to
implementing RichACL in Linux kernel. My recent contributions include
THP support for ppc64 and HugeTLB controller.
