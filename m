Sorry for the late response, but I'm interested in attending.  I didn't
think I would be able to justify the trip for the one-day meeting, but I
begged an invitation to the VM summit from Martin.  I still need to get
travel approval, but I'm optimistic that I can justify the trip now.

Thanks,
Shaggy
