This looks like an improvement. The essential part is that PG_reserved
page belongs to its user and no generic code should touch it. The rest
is a description of current users which I haven't checked due to to lack
of time but yeah, I like the updated wording because I have seen
multiple people confused from the swapped out part which is not true for
many many years. I have tried to dig out when it was actually the case
but failed.

So I cannot give my Ack because I didn't really do a real review but I
like this FWIW.
