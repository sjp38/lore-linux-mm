Subject: [PATCH 4/4] x86/boot/compressed/64: Handle 5-level paging boot if kernel is above 4G

This patch addresses a shortcoming in current boot process on machines
that supports 5-level paging.

If a bootloader enables 64-bit mode with 4-level paging, we might need to
switch over to 5-level paging. The switching requires the disabling
paging. It works fine if kernel itself is loaded below 4G.

But if the bootloader put the kernel above 4G (not sure if anybody does
this), we would lose control as soon as paging is disabled, because the
code becomes unreachable to the CPU.

This patch implements a trampoline in lower memory to handle this
situation.

We only need the memory for a very short time, until the main kernel
image sets up own page tables.

We go through the trampoline even if we don't have to: if we're already
in 5-level paging mode or if we don't need to switch to it. This way the
trampoline gets tested on every boot.
