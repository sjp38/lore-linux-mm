That depends on the nature of the pinning.  For the general case of 
get_user_pages(), you're correct that it won't work for anonymous memory.

Different subsystems will need to use different approaches to fixing the 
issue.  I doubt any single approach will work for everything.

What happens when more than one subsystem tries to pin a particular page?  
What if it's a shared page rather than an anonymous page?

Maybe that is the simplest approach, but it's going to make get_user_pages() 
slower and more complicated (as if it wasn't already).  Maybe with all the 
bells and whistles of per-cpu data structures and such you can make it work, 
but I'm pretty sure someone running the large unmentionable benchmark will 
complain about the performance regressions you're going to introduce.  At 
least in the case of the AIO ring buffer, using the address_space approach 
doesn't introduce any new performance issues.  There's also the bigger 
question of if you can or cannot exclude get_user_pages_fast() from this.  
In short: you've got a lot more work on your hands to do.
