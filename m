If  the  license of  your work  allows,  you could   open a project on
Sourcerforge,  Berlios  or Savannah  (under non-GNU  projects ;) ) and
import your CVS tree there.  I still have to  read your documents, but
I think this  is a wonderful  project and it's very worth contributing
to it - so any infrastructural help in this sense would make sense.

Thank you for your work, I'm looking forward to having a look to it.

bye,

andrea
