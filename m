Hi people,

I am an more or less experienced C programmer from Brazil.
I would like to help, but I really don't know where it would be better (more helpfull) to begin. The page TODO at linux-mm seams kind old.
So, if you think I could help in some way (I have some time to spent), please just point me something.
Hoping to help,

Carlos Boneti.
