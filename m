Hello all,

As a result of the increase in spam lately, I've implemented a new set 
of spam filters for the mailing lists.  This may result in postings 
getting delayed if they look like spam, but that hasn't been an issue 
for most of the past few thousand messages.  Also, a new mail server 
will be put in place soon, which will result in the lists being moved to 
@lists.kvack.org, so some procmail recipies will need to get updated.  
Cheers,

		-ben
