Right, sorry for taking so long at updating the docs. So I tried to
write a more useful comment to explain why it converges and what is
the objective of the math. This is the current status and it includes
everything related to the autonuma balancing and lots of documentation
on it (in fact almost more documentation than code), including the
part to prioritize CFS in picking from the autonuma_node.

If you consider this is _everything_ needed in terms of scheduler
code, I think it's quite simple, and with the docs it should be a lot
more clear.

Moving the callout out of schedule is the next step but it's only an
implementation issue (and I would already done it if only I could
schedule from softirq, but this isn't preempt-rt...).

/*
 * This function is responsible for deciding which is the best CPU
 * each process should be running on according to the NUMA statistics
 * collected in mm->mm_autonuma and tsk->task_autonuma.
 *
 * The core math that evaluates the current CPU against the CPUs of
 * all _other_ nodes is this:
 *
 *			if (w_nid > w_other && w_nid > w_cpu_nid) {
 *				weight = w_nid - w_other + w_nid - w_cpu_nid;
 *
 * w_nid: worthiness of moving the current thread/process to the other
 * CPU.
 *
 * w_other: worthiness of moving the thread/process running in the
 * other CPU to the current CPU.
 *
 * w_cpu_nid: worthiness of keeping the current thread/process in the
 * current CPU.
 *
 * We run the above math on every CPU not part of the current NUMA
 * node, and we compare the current process against the other
 * processes running in the other CPUs in the remote NUMA nodes. The
 * objective is to select the cpu (in selected_cpu) with a bigger
 * worthiness weight (calculated as w_nid - w_other + w_nid -
 * w_cpu_nid). The bigger the worthiness weight of the other CPU the
 * biggest gain we'll get by moving the current process to the
 * selected_cpu (not only the biggest immediate CPU gain but also the
 * fewer async memory migrations that will be required to reach full
 * convergence later). If we select a cpu we migrate the current
 * process to it.
 *
 * Checking that the other process prefers to run here (w_nid >
 * w_other) and not only that we prefer to run there (w_nid >
 * w_cpu_nid) completely avoids ping pongs and ensures (temporary)
 * convergence of the algorithm (at least from a CPU standpoint).
 *
 * It's then up to the idle balancing code that will run as soon as
 * the current CPU goes idle to pick the other process and move it
 * here.
 *
 * By only evaluating running processes against running processes we
 * avoid to interfere with the CFS stock active idle balancing so
 * critical to perform optimally with HT enabled (getting HT wrong is
 * worse than running on remote memory so the active idle balancing
 * has the priority). The idle balancing (and all other CFS load
 * balancing) is however NUMA aware through the introduction of
 * sched_autonuma_can_migrate_task(). CFS searches the CPUs in the
 * tsk->autonuma_node first when it needs to find idle CPUs during the
 * idle balancing or tasks to pick during the load balancing.
 *
 * Then in the background asynchronously the memory always slowly
 * follows the CPU. Here the CPU follows the memory as fast as it can
 * (as long as active idle balancing permits).
 *
 * One non trivial bit of this logic that deserves an explanation is
 * how the three crucial variables of the core math
 * (w_nid/w_other/wcpu_nid) are going to change depending if the other
 * CPU is running a thread of the current process, or a thread of a
 * different process. A simple example is required: assume there are 2
 * processes and 4 thread per process and two nodes with 4 CPUs
 * each. Because the total 8 threads belongs to two different
 * processes by using the process statistics when comparing threads of
 * different processes, we'll end up converging reliably and quickly
 * in a configuration where first process is entirely contained in the
 * first node and the second process is entirely contained in the
 * second node. Now if you knew in advance that all threads only use
 * thread local memory and there's no sharing of memory between the
 * different threads, it wouldn't matter if use per-thread or per-mm
 * statistics in the w_nid/w_other/wcpu_nid and we could use
 * per-thread statistics at all times. But clearly with threads it's
 * expectable to get some sharing of memory, so to avoid false sharing
 * it's better to keep all threads of the same process in the same
 * node (or if they don't fit in a single node, in as fewer nodes as
 * possible), and this is why we've to use processes statistics in
 * w_nid/w_other/wcpu_nid when comparing thread of different
 * processes. Why instead we've to use thread statistics when
 * comparing threads of the same process should be already obvious if
 * you're still reading (hint: the mm statistics are identical for
 * threads of the same process). If some process doesn't fit in one
 * node, the thread statistics will then distribute the threads to the
 * best nodes within the group of nodes where the process is
 * contained.
 *
 * This is an example of the CPU layout after the startup of 2
 * processes with 12 threads each:
 *
 * nid 0 mm ffff880433367b80 nr 6
 * nid 0 mm ffff880433367480 nr 5
 * nid 1 mm ffff880433367b80 nr 6
 * nid 1 mm ffff880433367480 nr 6
 *
 * And after a few seconds it becomes:
 *
 * nid 0 mm ffff880433367b80 nr 12
 * nid 1 mm ffff880433367480 nr 11
 *
 * You can see it happening yourself by enabling debug with sysfs.
 *
 * Before scanning all other CPUs runqueues to compute the above math,
 * we also verify that we're not already in the preferred nid from the
 * point of view of both the process statistics and the thread
 * statistics. In such case we can return to the caller without having
 * to check any other CPUs runqueues because full convergence has been
 * already reached.
 *
 * Ideally this should be expanded to take all runnable processes into
 * account but this is a good enough approximation because some
 * runnable processes may run only for a short time so statistically
 * there will always be a bias on the processes that uses most the of
 * the CPU and that's ideal (if a process runs only for a short time,
 * it won't matter too much if the NUMA balancing isn't optimal for
 * it).
 *
 * This function is invoked at the same frequency of the load balancer
 * and only if the CPU is not idle. The rest of the time we depend on
 * CFS to keep sticking to the current CPU or to prioritize on the
 * CPUs in the selected_nid recorded in the task autonuma_node.
