In current memcg, charges associated with a task aren't moved to the new cgroup
at task migration. Some users feel this behavior to be strange.
These patches are for this feature, that is, for charging to the new cgroup
and, of course, uncharging from the old cgroup at task migration.

This patch adds "memory.move_charge_at_immigrate" file, which is a flag file to
determine whether charges should be moved to the new cgroup at task migration or
not and what type of charges should be moved. This patch also adds read and
write handlers of the file.

This patch also adds no-op handlers for this feature. These handlers will be
implemented in later patches. And you cannot write any values other than 0
to move_charge_at_immigrate yet.

Changelog: 2009/12/14
- Add TODO section to meory.txt.
Changelog: 2009/12/04
- change the term "recharge" to "move_charge".
- update document.
Changelog: 2009/11/19
- consolidate changes in Documentation/cgroup/memory.txt, which were made in
  other patches separately.
- handle recharge_at_immigrate as bitmask(as I did in first version).
- use mm->owner instead of thread_group_leader().
Changelog: 2009/09/24
- change the term "migration" to "recharge".
- handle the flag as bool not bitmask to make codes simple.

+8. Move charges at task migration
+
+Users can move charges associated with a task along with task migration, that
+is, uncharge task's pages from the old cgroup and charge them to the new cgroup.
+
+8.1 Interface
+
+This feature is disabled by default. It can be enabled(and disabled again) by
+writing to memory.move_charge_at_immigrate of the destination cgroup.
+
+If you want to enable it:
+
+# echo (some positive value) > memory.move_charge_at_immigrate
+
+Note: Each bits of move_charge_at_immigrate has its own meaning about what type
+      of charges should be moved. See 8.2 for details.
+Note: Charges are moved only when you move mm->owner, IOW, a leader of a thread
+      group.
+Note: If we cannot find enough space for the task in the destination cgroup, we
+      try to make space by reclaiming memory. Task migration may fail if we
+      cannot make enough space.
+Note: It can take several seconds if you move charges in giga bytes order.
+
+And if you want disable it again:
+
+# echo 0 > memory.move_charge_at_immigrate
+

+      | Those pages and swaps must be used only by the target task. You must
+      | enable Swap Extension(see 2.4) to enable move of swap charges.
+
+Note: Those pages and swaps must be charged to the old cgroup.
+Note: More type of pages(e.g. file cache, shmem,) will be supported by other
+      bits in future.
+
+8.3 TODO
+
+- Add support for other types of pages(e.g. file cache, shmem, etc.).
+- Implement madvise(2) to let users decide the vma to be moved or not to be
+  moved.
+- All of moving charge operations are done under cgroup_mutex. It's not good
+  behavior to hold the mutex too long, so we may need some trick.
+
+9. TODO
 
 1. Add support for accounting huge pages (as a separate controller)
 2. Make per-cgroup scanner reclaim not-shared pages first
