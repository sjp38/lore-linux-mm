I do think that we should correct the shrink file to do what it is
designed to do to include the memcg caches as well.

The /proc/slabinfo file is a well-known file that is probably used
relatively extensively. Making it to scan through all the per-cpu
structures will probably cause performance issues as the slab_mutex has
to be taken during the whole duration of the scan. That could have
undesirable side effect.

Instead, I am thinking about extending the slab/objects sysfs file to
also show the number of objects hold up by the per-cpu structures and
thus we can get an accurate count by subtracting it from the reported
active objects. That will have a more limited performance impact as it
is just one kmem cache instead of all the kmem caches in the system.
Also the sysfs files are not as commonly used as slabinfo. That will be
another patch in the near future.

Cheers,
Longman
