Right, so with whatever we come up, it should allow to make a decision
in user space about
- if memory is to be onlined automatically
- to which zone memory is to be onlined

The rules are encoded in user space, the type will allow to make a
decision. One important part will be if the memory can eventually be
offlined + removed again (DIMM style unplug) vs. memory unplug is
handled balloon-style.

As we learned, some use cases might require to e.g. online balloon
memory to the movable zone in order to make better use of huge pages.
This has to be handled in user space.

I'll think about possible types.

Yes, that makes sense.
