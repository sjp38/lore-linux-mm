I think most of the defensive structures are covering rare to almost
impossible cases - but those are precisely the hard ones to understand if
they do happen.

The question is how soon does it blow-up if it were imediate then three is
probably no real difference if there is some delay say due to the region
affected by the NULL pointer not being imediately in use - it may be very
hard to differenciate between an allocation failure and memory corruption
so having a directly associated trace should be significantly simpler to
understand - and you might actually not want a system to try booting if there
are problems at this level.
