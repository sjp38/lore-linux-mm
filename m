Actually, I think we're fine.  What was happening was that two faults were
racing for a private mapping.  One was installing a RW PTE for the COW page
cache page via wp_page_copy(), and the second was trying to install a
read-only PTE in insert_pfn().  The PFNs don't match because the two faults
are trying to map very different PTEs - one for DAX storage, one for a page
cache page.

This collision is handled by insert_pfn() by just returning -EBUSY, which will
bail out of the fault and either re-fault if necessary, or use the PTE that
the other thread installed.  For the case I described above I think both
faults will just happily use the page cache page, and the RO DAX fault won't
be retried.

I think this is fine, and I'll preserve this behavior as you suggest in the
mkwrite case by validating that the PTE is what we think it should be after we
grab the PTL.
