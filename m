I'd suggest the O'Reilly books on system administration for this kind
of information. A general tour of the manpages (type "man man" to get
started) sounds like something that might be good for you also. There's
a lot of good material in them, and I refer to them routinely.

BTW, the kernelnewbies mailing list is about C language programming in
the kernel, and the linux-mm mailing list about virtual memory
management programming in the kernel. Some of the questions you've
posted are probably best dealt with elsewhere, e.g. on other mailing
lists, as they haven't tended to be very related to kernel programming.

Could someone give him a pointer to a mailing list or other support
forum (newsgroup? anything) that would be of the right flavor? I've not
done much in the way of system administration.

If you're doing kernel programming after all, but are just having a
tough time getting set up, you should probably still try going
elsewhere for the bits about setting up your system properly.
