Hello all,

Sorry about the list being down since Thursday night and any bounces that
occurred while bringing things online today -- an upgrade went wrong and
completely ruined my linux distribution.  Things are on a new machine
which should be faster (it's running zmailer & using raid0).  Let me know
if there are any problems or things that appear wrong (this is also a test
message to see if headers are generating correctly...).  Cheers,

		-ben
