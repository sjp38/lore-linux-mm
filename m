Hi
        I have just released a collection of programs for testing
(stressing) the memory system.  Just now the suite is very small, but
if you send your tests, we can obtain a very good testing suite for
the Linux kernel memory system.  I have attached the announcement of
the memory test suite.

Later, Juan.


Memory test suite v0.0.1
------------------------

This is the first version.

This intends to be a set of programs to test the memory management
system.  I am releasing this version with the idea of gather more
programs for the suite.  If you have some program to test the system,
please send it to me (quintela@fi.udc.es).

If you found values/combinations of tests for what the system
crash/Oops/whatever please report it to me.  Then I can include it in
the tests and the people who tune the MM system can test it next time.

Any comments/suggestions/code are welcome.

Thanks for your time,
        Juan Quintela
