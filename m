Changelog:
v7 - v6
- Addressed comments from Michal Hocko
- memblock_discard() patch was removed from this series and integrated
  separately
- Fixed bug reported by kbuild test robot new patch:
  mm: zero reserved and unavailable struct pages
- Removed patch
  x86/mm: reserve only exiting low pages
  As, it is not needed anymore, because of the previous fix
- Re-wrote deferred_init_memmap(), found and fixed an existing bug, where
  page variable is not reset when zone holes present.
- Merged several patches together per Michal request
- Added performance data including raw logs

v6 - v5
- Fixed ARM64 + kasan code, as reported by Ard Biesheuvel
- Tested ARM64 code in qemu and found few more issues, that I fixed in this
  iteration
- Added page roundup/rounddown to x86 and arm zeroing routines to zero the
  whole allocated range, instead of only provided address range.
- Addressed SPARC related comment from Sam Ravnborg
- Fixed section mismatch warnings related to memblock_discard().

v5 - v4
- Fixed build issues reported by kbuild on various configurations

v4 - v3
- Rewrote code to zero sturct pages in __init_single_page() as
  suggested by Michal Hocko
- Added code to handle issues related to accessing struct page
  memory before they are initialized.

v3 - v2
- Addressed David Miller comments about one change per patch:
    * Splited changes to platforms into 4 patches
    * Made "do not zero vmemmap_buf" as a separate patch

v2 - v1
- Per request, added s390 to deferred "struct page" zeroing
- Collected performance data on x86 which proofs the importance to
  keep memset() as prefetch (see below).

SMP machines can benefit from the DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT config option,
which defers initializing struct pages until all cpus have been started so
it can be done in parallel.

However, this feature is sub-optimal, because the deferred page
initialization code expects that the struct pages have already been zeroed,
and the zeroing is done early in boot with a single thread only.  Also, we
access that memory and set flags before struct pages are initialized. All
of this is fixed in this patchset.

In this work we do the following:
- Never read access struct page until it was initialized
- Never set any fields in struct pages before they are initialized
- Zero struct page at the beginning of struct page initialization
