I would like to announce a new mailinglist devoted to the
development of kiobuf based IO pathes.  The address is

	kiobuf-io-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

Stephen Tweedie has also suggested to collect varoius kiobuf-
related patches on that sourceforge project, so if you have
such patches contact me to become developer/admin in that
project.

	Christoph
