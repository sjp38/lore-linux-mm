	So I dont know if this is quite something I should post to this list, but I got a laugh out of it, and so may all of you. Any of you familliar with Oracle under Linux, may or may not have run into, what in my opinion, has been a large lacking on their front concearning Oracle's attention to quality in the Linux port. Apart from the handfull of install issues with the 8.0.5 release, to the documentation which was sent, being the solaris documentation which was basically just :s/solaris/linux'd.
	So now to the funny part... Months now have I been waiting for a copy of the Oracle 8i port that they have been promising, and even longer for it to ship. About a week ago, it finally arrives in the mail. I inspect the CD case to find, in nice black letters the words "Oralce 8i Enterprise Edition" or some such nonsense, further inspection finds the same on the back side of the CD case, with one minor exception, it reads "Oracle 8i for *Linus*". So, happy birthday Linus, Oracle loves you.

Feel free to send me hate mail for wasting everyone's time.
