+5.5 dirty memory
+
+Control the maximum amount of dirty pages a cgroup can have at any given time.
+
+Limiting dirty memory is like fixing the max amount of dirty (hard to reclaim)
+page cache used by a cgroup.  So, in case of multiple cgroup writers, they will
+not be able to consume more than their designated share of dirty pages and will
+be forced to perform write-out if they cross that limit.
+
+The interface is equivalent to the procfs interface: /proc/sys/vm/dirty_*.  It
+is possible to configure a limit to trigger both a direct writeback or a
+background writeback performed by per-bdi flusher threads.  The root cgroup
+memory.dirty_* control files are read-only and match the contents of
+the /proc/sys/vm/dirty_* files.
+
+Per-cgroup dirty limits can be set using the following files in the cgroupfs:
+
+- memory.dirty_ratio: the amount of dirty memory (expressed as a percentage of
+  cgroup memory) at which a process generating dirty pages will itself start
+  writing out dirty data.
+
+- memory.dirty_bytes: the amount of dirty memory (expressed in bytes) in the
+  cgroup at which a process generating dirty pages will start itself writing out
+  dirty data.
+
+- memory.dirty_background_ratio: the amount of dirty memory of the cgroup
+  (expressed as a percentage of cgroup memory) at which background writeback
+  kernel threads will start writing out dirty data.
+
+- memory.dirty_background_bytes: the amount of dirty memory (expressed in bytes)
+  in the cgroup at which background writeback kernel threads will start writing
+  out dirty data.
+
 6. Hierarchy support
 
 The memory controller supports a deep hierarchy and hierarchical accounting.
