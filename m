uh, yeah, appended.  The patch-related backlog appears to number
800-900 emails.  It's gonna be a fun week.

btw, I'm rather concerned about -mm's MM changes from you and Rik - I
saw a lot of emails go by but it's unclear that there was enough stuff
there to get all of this stabilised.  Were you paying much attention?
