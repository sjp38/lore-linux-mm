Subject: [PATCH v3 4/4] mm: refresh ZONE_DMA and ZONE_DMA32 comments in 'enum zone_type'

These zones usage has evolved with time and the comments were outdated.
This joins both ZONE_DMA and ZONE_DMA32 explanation and gives up to date
examples on how they are used on different architectures.

Changes in v3:
- Update comment to match changes in arm64

Changes in v2:
- Try another approach merging both ZONE_DMA comments into one
- Address Christoph's comments
- If this approach doesn't get much traction I'll just drop the patch
  from the series as it's not really essential

+	 * On architectures where this area covers the whole 32 bit address

+	 * platforms may need both zones as they support peripherals with
+	 * different DMA addressing limitations.
+	 *
+	 * Some examples:
+	 *
+	 *  - i386 and x86_64 have a fixed 16M ZONE_DMA and ZONE_DMA32 for the
+	 *    rest of the lower 4G.
+	 *
+	 *  - arm only uses ZONE_DMA, the size, up to 4G, may vary depending on
+	 *    the specific device.
+	 *
+	 *  - arm64 has a fixed 1G ZONE_DMA and ZONE_DMA32 for the rest of the
+	 *    lower 4G.
