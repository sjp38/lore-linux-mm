>From what I observed the problem is mainly with lru_add_pvec, the
rest is near empty for most of the time. I added debug code to
 lru_add_drain_all(), to see sizes of the lru pvecs when I debugged this.

Among lru_add_pvec, lru_rotate_pvecs, lru_deactivate_file_pvecs,=20
lru_deactivate_pvecs, activate_page_pvecs almost all (3-4GB) of the=20
missing memory was in lru_add_pvec, the rest was almost always empty.

Below are more detailed logs of each list size in the same order as above=20
(list length -> sum of all pages on the list - for lru_add_pvec and=20
activate_page_pvecs). "combined_len =3D X, combined_size =3D Y MB"
 -  X: combined length of lru_add_pvec and Y: sum of all page sizes in
 lru_add_pvec.

After compaction, before running workload, lru_add_drain_all:

Agree, I can try to prepare another patch for that.
