Subject: [v2 PATCH 1/2] mm: swap: check if swap backing device is congested or not

Swap readahead would read in a few pages regardless if the underlying
device is busy or not.  It may incur long waiting time if the device is
congested, and it may also exacerbate the congestion.

Use inode_read_congested() to check if the underlying device is busy or
not like what file page readahead does.  Get inode from swap_info_struct.
Although we can add inode information in swap_address_space
(address_space->host), it may lead some unexpected side effect, i.e.
it may break mapping_cap_account_dirty().  Using inode from
swap_info_struct seems simple and good enough.

Just does the check in vma_cluster_readahead() since
swap_vma_readahead() is just used for non-rotational device which
much less likely has congestion than traditional HDD.

Although swap slots may be consecutive on swap partition, it still may be
fragmented on swap file. This check would help to reduce excessive stall
for such case.
