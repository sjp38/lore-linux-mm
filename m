SOLICITING FOR A BUSINESS VENTURE AND PARTNERSHIP 

I am the son of the late president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, President Mobutu Sese 
Seko, (now Republic of Congo, 
under the leadership of the son of Mr. Laurent Kabila). I presume you are aware there is a 
financial dispute between my family 
(THE MOBUTU) and the present civilian Government. This is based on what they believe 
as bad and corrupt governance on 
my late father's part. May his soul rest in Perfect peace. 

Presently, we cannot do business here in Holland and many countries of the World 
because of the new friendly relationship 
between the present government and the Western World. As you might have heard how a 
lot of my father's bank account in 
Switzerland and North American have since been frozen. 

Following the above mentioned reasons ,I am soliciting for your humble and confidential 
assistance to take custody of Fifteen 
Million United States Dollars (US$15,000,000.00), also to front for me in the areas of 
business you desire profitable. 

This sum of US$15M has secretly been deposited into a confidential Security Company, 
where it can easily be withdrawn or 
paid to a recommended beneficiary. The funds will be released to you by the Security 
Company based on my 
recommendations, on that note, you will be presented as my partner who will be fronting for 
me and my family in any 
subsequent ventures. 

To show my preparedness and the appreciation to conduct this business with you, I shall 
give you and your family 20% of the 
funds and 20% commission on any profit realizable in the process of investment of this 
funds. For your role in this business, 
we are willing to make available 5% for any eventual cost that may occur in the process of 
this transaction. 

Please, I need your entire support and co-operation for the success of this business 
ventures, your utmost confidentiality and 
secrecy is highly required, due to my family present predicament. 

I sincerely will appreciate your acknowledgement by fax or telephone as soon as possible. 

Yours truly, 

MR. DUBE MOBUTU.
