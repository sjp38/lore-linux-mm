I've gone through v3 patches 2-9 and have plucked out the deltas to
take what-i-had and turn that into what-you-sent.  Patch 1/9 has seen a
lot of competing churn in isolate_freepages_block(), so please review
the current version of that, below.  Between the "===" markers:


static unsigned long isolate_freepages_block(struct compact_control *cc,
				unsigned long *start_pfn,
				unsigned long end_pfn,
				struct list_head *freelist,
				bool strict)
{
	int nr_scanned = 0, total_isolated = 0;
	struct page *cursor, *valid_page = NULL;
	unsigned long flags = 0;
	bool locked = false;
	unsigned long blockpfn = *start_pfn;
	unsigned int order;

	cursor = pfn_to_page(blockpfn);

	/* Isolate free pages. */
	for (; blockpfn < end_pfn; blockpfn++, cursor++) {
		int isolated;
		struct page *page = cursor;

		/*
		 * Periodically drop the lock (if held) regardless of its
		 * contention, to give chance to IRQs. Abort if fatal signal
		 * pending or async compaction detects need_resched()
		 */
		if (!(blockpfn % SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX)
		    && compact_unlock_should_abort(&cc->zone->lock, flags,
								&locked, cc))
			break;

		nr_scanned++;
		if (!pfn_valid_within(blockpfn))
			goto isolate_fail;

		if (!valid_page)
			valid_page = page;

		/*
		 * For compound pages such as THP and hugetlbfs, we can save
		 * potentially a lot of iterations if we skip them at once.
		 * The check is racy, but we can consider only valid values
		 * and the only danger is skipping too much.
		 */
		if (PageCompound(page)) {
			unsigned int comp_order = compound_order(page);

			if (likely(comp_order < MAX_ORDER)) {
				blockpfn += (1UL << comp_order) - 1;
				cursor += (1UL << comp_order) - 1;
			}

			goto isolate_fail;
		}

		if (!PageBuddy(page))
			goto isolate_fail;

====================
		/*
		 * If we already hold the lock, we can skip some rechecking.
		 * Note that if we hold the lock now, checked_pageblock was
		 * already set in some previous iteration (or strict is true),
		 * so it is correct to skip the suitable migration target
		 * recheck as well.
		 */
		if (!locked) {
			/*
			 * The zone lock must be held to isolate freepages.
			 * Unfortunately this is a very coarse lock and can be

			 * or parallel compactions. For async compaction do not

			 * possible.

		}

		/* Found a free page, will break it into order-0 pages */
		order = page_order(page);
		isolated = __isolate_free_page(page, order);
		if (!isolated)
			break;
		set_page_private(page, order);

		total_isolated += isolated;
		cc->nr_freepages += isolated;
		list_add_tail(&page->lru, freelist);

		if (!strict && cc->nr_migratepages <= cc->nr_freepages) {
			blockpfn += isolated;
			break;
		}
		/* Advance to the end of split page */
		blockpfn += isolated - 1;
		cursor += isolated - 1;
		continue;

isolate_fail:
=====================
		if (strict)
			break;
		else
			continue;

	}

	if (locked)
		spin_unlock_irqrestore(&cc->zone->lock, flags);
