It's described in Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming" and my guess is 
that it is attributed to whomever Knuth recognized as its inventor. I believe 
it predates "The Art Of Computer Programming". My guess is that it was old news 
in 1968, which is the earliest date I've seen so far in this thread. I learned 
programming in 1962 and I think it was in existence then.
