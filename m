hi,
i am fresh graduate and working in a System software company where i
have to upgrade KGDB be to new kernel and move it newer platforms. 
I did a small mini project for my college to partition the memory and
CPU resources among processes as per administrators needs. (something
like CKRM on which Riel is working). Its abstract is at
www.dreamzgroup.com/trinity.html
I wanted to work on Linux MM in my spare time but the TODO list is very
old and outdated. Can someone please guide me .i have already subscribed
to MM mailing list.
