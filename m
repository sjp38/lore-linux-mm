Add a interface to postpone an action until the end of the entire
checkpoint or restart operation. This is useful when during the
scan of tasks an operation cannot be performed in place, to avoid
the need for a second scan.

One use case is when restoring an ipc shared memory region that has
been deleted (but is still attached), during restart it needs to be
create, attached and then deleted. However, creation and attachment
are performed in distinct locations, so deletion can not be performed
on the spot. Instead, this work (delete) is deferred until later.
(This example is in one of the following patches).

This interface allows chronic procrastination in the kernel:

deferqueue_create(void):
    Allocates and returns a new deferqueue.

deferqueue_run(deferqueue):
    Executes all the pending works in the queue. Returns the number
    of works executed, or an error upon the first error reported by
    a deferred work.

deferqueue_add(deferqueue, data, size, func, dtor):
    Enqueue a deferred work. @function is the callback function to
    do the work, which will be called with @data as an argument.
    @size tells the size of data. @dtor is a destructor callback
    that is invoked for deferred works remaining in the queue when
    the queue is destroyed. NOTE: for a given deferred work, @dtor
    is _not_ called if @func was already called (regardless of the
    return value of the latter).

deferqueue_destroy(deferqueue):
    Free the deferqueue and any queued items while invoking the
    @dtor callback for each queued item.

Why aren't we using the existing kernel workqueue mechanism?  We need
to defer to work until the end of the operation: not earlier, since we
need other things to be in place; not later, to not block waiting for
it. However, the workqueue schedules the work for 'some time later'.
Also, the kernel workqueue may run in any task context, but we require
many times that an operation be run in the context of some specific
restarting task (e.g., restoring IPC state of a certain ipc_ns).

Instead, this mechanism is a simple way for the c/r operation as a
whole, and later a task in particular, to defer some action until
later (but not arbitrarily later) _in the restore_ operation.
