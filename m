If you can reproduce this test and tell us exactly how we
can reproduce it here, then I'll take a look at the problem.

If you can get more details, like vmstat output, ..., could
you file a bug in the linux-mm bugzilla ?

(if you keep it on mail, you can be sure we'll all have
forgotten about this within 3 weeks)
