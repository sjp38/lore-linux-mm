Hi everybody,

   I had some problem of seg fault (gv among others) after adding 64Mb to my
   Latitude Dell laptop. I'm running Linux version 2.2.12-20 R-H 6.1.

   Is there some software to test the memory. The problem is really very
   discontinuous, annoying in these days and a couple of month ago, almost
   invisible in the meantime.

   Thanks in advance for possible hints. I'm not on the list and would
   appreciate any pointers to possible documentation/solution directly to me.

   Thanks
   sandro
