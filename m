Hello,
Compliment of the day to you, I would like to use this
medium to introduce my self to you, though we have not
met before. I am Marie Eyadema a widow to the Late
Eyadema of Togo who just died,  I know you might be
surprised to receive this kind of proposal from me but
my instincts motivated me to write you due to my
present situation which I hope you may be of help.

My late husband got married to three wives as African
culture demanded, I was lucky to be the favourite
among all, I was so close to my husband when he was
still alive. After his death I have been persecuted by
other wives out of jealousy; before the death of my
husband, he enstrusted to me a substantial amount of
money.

 This money was budgeted for his new company
project which he had at hand before he died. This
money was being kept in my possession due to the trust he
had on me.

Now that the First son of the Family has taken over
the office as the new head of government in Togo, my
life and that of my children are in great danger due to
family crisis; so, luckyly for me and my children we
were able to move away with the money from Togo to Dakar
Senegal where I and the children are residing at the
moment and we have deposited the money with a Trust and
Security company for safe keeping pending the time we will be
able to find a trusted person who will help in moving
this cash out of Africa for investment in a developed
economy.

What I want you to do is to indicate your interest
that you will assist us by receiving the money on our
behalf. Acknowledge this message, so that I can
introduce you to my son (Malik) who has the modalities
for the claim of the funds. I want you to assist
in investing this money, but I will not want my
identity revealed. I will also like to buy properties
and stock in multinational companies and to engage in
other safe and non-speculative investment portfolios.
May I at this point emphasis the high level of confidentiality
which this business demands, and hope you will not
betray the trust and confidence, which I entrust on
you.

 In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son
will put you in the picture of the
business by telling you were the funds are currently
being kept, and also discuss other modalities including
remunerations for your service.
 
Kindly furnish us your contact information, that is
your personal telephone and fax
numbers for confidential purposes and acknowledge
receipt of this mail

Do contact me through this email address : eyademarie@yahoo.co.uk

Best regards
Mrs Marie Eyadema.
