Also, in all fairness, we should probably display a certain amount of humility: 
while Linux has certainly reached milestones such as world domination (as far 
as large and small computers are concerned), so calling it 3.0 is a fair deal, 
we probably have to wait for version 42.0 before we can consider the Linux 
kernel to be the ultimate answer to life, universe and everything.
