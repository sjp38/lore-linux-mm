Rik,  or whoever is the listadmin..

Yesterday I blocked this  "big@boss.com" appearing at the From:-header,
after about half dozen of these viruses (apparently) went thru VGER's
lists.  It seems to be the lattest email "bad message" in vogue.
I have also body-filter-pattern     m!name=".*\.pif"!     just to be
on the safe side..  (that could, of course, trap this message...)
