  It is foolish to deal with a fool Too much sit down ah bruck trousers. Experience is a great servant He who has once burnt his mouth always blows his soup Might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb . When one shears the sheep, the skin on the ram trembles  A penny saved is.. not much.<BR><BR><BR>None but the wearer knows where the shoe pinches A worry shared is a worry halved. Folly grows without watering Men are from earth Women are from earth Deal with it  
  Not to know is bad; not to wish to know is worse  Faith will move mountains. The best advice is found on the pillow It is better to love and lost than never to love at all<BR><BR>What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity Laughter is the best medicine. He who gathers crops in summer is a wise son, but he who sleeps during harvest is a disgraceful son  The cobra will bite you whether you call it cobra or Mr Cobra  
  A friend in need is a friend indeed. The early bird catches the worm The trouble with experience is that by the time you have it, you are too old to take advantage of it What boots up must come down. One good turn deserves another. To whom God gives, to him also the people give  He who sups with the devil should have a long spoon Too many clicks spoil the browse  Fish and guests smell in three days<BR><BR><BR>Never murder a man who is committing suicide 
  Actions speak louder than words. Many people know how to say nothing; few know when My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother. Empty sacks will never stand upright Take heed of reconciled enemies and of meat twice boiled  Use it or lose it Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit.<BR><BR><BR>Don't bite the hand that.. looks dirty. A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels. Love sees no faults. Better bend than break 
  He who works his land will have abundant food, but the one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty Never put off til tomorrow what you can do today</font></p>
