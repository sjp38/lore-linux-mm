then I'd like to set that impression straight (and burry the
conspiracy theories)... I've never asked David to do this for any kind
of legal theory or otherwise. Any of it, tg3 or otherwise. And while I
can't speak for Intel on legal aspects (if there are any here), I can
speak as Davids manager that this entire project hasn't originated from
anything we (Intel) asked him to do.
