Yup, I _am_ going for the record...

After receiving several messages about kswapd using too
much CPU time with my vhand-2.1.65b patch, I decided to
fix the problem and release the patch with linux-2.1.66
Since there was no linux(2.1.66) released this weekend,
and I still got messages from people, I decided to make
a new record:  the highest number of patch-releases for
1 (development!) kernel-version...

And thus: vhand-2.1.65c saw the light :)
You can see the light too, at http://www.fys.ruu.nl/~riel/

grtz,

Rik.
