Trying to intimidate people into doing what you want is a well known
social tool. A The particular problem here is that it's the corporate
power structure that's used to effect the intimidation. A That's pretty
much outside of our control (unless we work for the same company), so
there's not much we can do to stop it except say you shouldn't try to
intimidate reviewers. A I suppose one practical policy could be
demanding reviews from independent (meaning outside the corporate power
structure) people.

Well, I think this fits neatly in the giving and receiving and
receiving criticism bucket. The first rule of interacting with others
is "never attribute to malice something which could possibly be
accidental". A In the end it's up to the maintainer to arbitrate based
on their opinion of the merits of the review.
