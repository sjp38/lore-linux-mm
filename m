Do we really only ever use these three and not anything else when
adding/removing/onlining/offlining memory?

(I am thinking e.g. about pgdat_resize_lock)

If so, you should phrase that maybe more generally Or add more details :)

"In addition to fine grained locks like pgdat_resize_lock, there are
three locks involved ..."
