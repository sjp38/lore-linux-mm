I wasn't trying to get into a contest.  When someone mentioned that they 
know of papers to support an interesting position, I just want to know 
what those papers are, as the resulting list may include some that I haven'
t seen.

Are you thinking of the paper on the SEQ replacement policy by Glass and 
Cao?  If so, be skeptical of their trace gathering methods.  They gathered 
and reduced their traces in an ad-hoc manner that left some serious 
limitations to the use of those traces.  They also don't mention reference 
behavior modeling at all; they simply gathered some traces based on the 
spec95 benchmark, tested their new page replacement policy, and showed the 
results.

Also try Johnstone and Wilson, ``The Memory Fragmentation Problem: Solved?
'' (International Symposium on Memory Management '98) -- it's a later 
version of that same work.  I'm unfamiliar with the second paper you 
mentioned, but you should also see Zorn and Grunwald, ``Evaluating Models 
of Memory Allocation'' (U. Colorado tech report from '92), in which they 
claim that many simple models are good, but none good enough to synthesize 
a full system workload.

For reference behavior, an old citation, but perhaps a useful one, is 
Richard Carr's ``Virtual Memory Management'' (Ph.D. thesis, 1984 or 
thereabouts), in which he address a number of approaches to modeling, 
their shortcomings, and then presents a new one that is probably better, 
but goes unvalidated against real program behavior.

That's likely true.  Use of models for reference traces seemed to die out 
about 15 years ago, as gathering real reference traces became more 
feasible (larger storage, faster chips for compression, etc.)
