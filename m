Dear Jayde Member,

We are currently upgrading the technology powering the Jayde.com Directory.
This could temporarily affect your listing. If you are unable to find your
website listing in the directory it should be automatically reinstated
within 4-6 weeks. To search for your listing go here:

Additionally, via Jayde.com's affiliation with WebProWire.com you can now
add internet news headlines to your site at no charge. You can even 
customize the logo and look to fit your site. It is a simple as cutting and
pasting some code on one or more pages of your site and headlines will
appear automatically. To add headlines to your site go here:
