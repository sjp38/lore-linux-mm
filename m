As a side-note, I did test a patch that checked pte_write and preserved
it across both faults and setting the protections. It did not alter
migration activity much but there was a  drop in minor faults - 20% drop in
autonumabench, 58% drop in xfsrepair workload. I'm assuming this is due to
refaults to mark pages writable.  The patch looks and is hacky so I won't
post it to save people bleaching their eyes. I'll spend some time soon
(hopefully today) at a smooth way of falling through to WP checks after
trapping a NUMA fault.
