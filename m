Dear President,

I crave your indulgence to make this initial contact as I write 
this letter of assistance with a great sense of honour and 
responsibility. I am sorry for the embarrassment this letter 
might cause you, as we have not had any previous contact.       

Iam Alh Waziri  Gambo head of Treasury Department in Federal 
Ministry of Justice .I and the late attorney general of the 
federation and also minister of Justice of federal republic of 
Nigeria, Chief Bola Ige who was short dead on 23rd of December 
2001 by unknown people declared by the government in place. 
Before he was murdered, the present government gave him Thirty -
Seven million dollars for the renovation of all Justice 
ministries in the federation but he didn t execute the job, 
rather he asked me to keep it in the security firm for his 2003 
Presidential Election bid. Now that he is dead and we have a 
new appointed Attorney General, he is not aware of the fund 
except I and the late Ige. My friend I will like you to 
understand that this is my opportunity to get rich like other 
Government officials as opportunity come but once in a life 
time. Now I want to move this money out of Nigeria for security 
reasons and also for my investment plans abroad  ie  Asia, 
Europe, Middle east or America due to the situation in my 
country.

I am therefore soliciting for your  assistance to enable me 
transfer this funds into your account as the owner of the funds 
for security reasons as you can see am still a civil servant  
and I cannot have this kind of amount in my possession. I 
therefore request for your help and will be immensely grateful 
for your acceptance and willingness. It may interest you to 
know that I have access to most of the requirements it will 
take to grant  your request and as the owner of the fund 
including the bank co-ordinates for our mutual benefit. I will 
also provide you with answer to the security company questions 
. This may sound very strange and funny because of the 
magnitude of the fund but the good thing is that the entire 
transfer procedure is transparent, as you will have opportunity 
to partake first hand in the entire transfer procedure thereby 
erasing all doubts. Your commission / remuneration in this 
matter is also subject to negotiation. You may wonder why I 
have to send you mail rather than calling you on the phone to 
discuss this, it because if I called you  on the phone you will 
not understand me, that is why I choose to send mail first.

On your readiness I shall fully acguaint you with details and 
transfer procedure, if you are interested in helping us please 
endeavour to indicate that by return mail  to this email 
address:dr_gambo2002@yahoo.co.uk, if not get rid of this mail and 
do forgive me if this message has upset you in any way, hoping 
we can do business.

Best Regards
Alh.  Wazairi  Gambo.
