Hello,

We sent you an email a while ago, because you now qualify
for a much lower rate based on the biggest rate drop in years.

You can now get $327,000 for as little as $617 a month!
Bad credit? Doesn't matter, low rates are fixed no matter what!

Follow this link to process your application and a 24 hour approval:
