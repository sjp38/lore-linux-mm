Hi,

since it seems that people are relying on the Linux-MM
web site to get information about the Linux VM subsystem,
it may be time for me to update the site and put newer
information in place...

However, at the moment I'm quite busy making the VM
subsystem work and doing lots of other stuff, so as you
might have guessed from the subject, I'm looking for
volunteers to help with the Linux-MM website.

The website is under CVS, so helping with the site is
relatively easy.

regards,

Rik
