This is an automated reply to the submission of your network abuse incident.  Please take time to read it carefully because it provides insight to your reported incident and guidelines for future submissions to the Covad Network Abuse Team.

Covad's Policy on Network Abuse:  We would like to thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.  We take network abuse very seriously within the Covad domain, and we apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you. Due to the large number of complaints we receive, we may not provide any further response regarding this incident.  However, Covad investigates each reported incident of abuse, and we will take all appropriate action to warn, suspend, and/or terminate a subscriber that has violated Covad's Acceptable Use Policy or Terms of Service. 

Covad's Guidelines for Reporting Suspected Network Abuse:  When reporting a network abuse incident to Covad's Network Abuse Team you must follow the submission guidelines below to expedite the investigation process.  If you fail to follow these guidelines we may not process your request or we may be delayed in processing your request.  We process abuse requests on a First-In-First-Out basis, prioritized by the level of network abuse a customer is experiencing.  Also, please do not submit more than one request per network abuse incident.  This will ensure that each occurrence is addressed in the most efficient manner possible.

Network Abuse Submission Guidelines

1. Provide a brief, general description of the network abuse incident.

2. Include all logs or information relevant to the incident; ensure the logs you're submitting contain:

   a. Date of incident
   b. Time of incident and time zone
   c. Source Internet protocol (IP) address or host name
   d. Destination IP addresses or host name
   e. Destination port

3. For e-mail abuse (i.e., Spam), include full-unmodified header information and content of the email.  Header information is a requirement for reporting e-mail abuse.  Without the header information, the Abuse Team cannot determine the true originator of the e-mail and will be unable to take any action.  If you are unsure how to extract a full-unmodified header, please visit http://spamcop.net/fom-serve/cache/19.html for instructions to support your mail client. 

4. For alleged off topic (non-spam) or commercial Usenet postings, we also need full un-modified headers of the Usenet posting including the body of the offending message.  If you are unsure how to view the full-unmodified headers of the Usenet post, consult the help section of your newsreader software or your news provider.

Covad cannot investigate an incident of network abuse without the information requested above.  In addition, Covad only investigates incidents of network abuse regarding Covad subscribers.  Non-subscribers should be reported to their appropriate ISP for network abuse resolution.  Please be advised that Covad does not disclose personally identifiable information about our subscribers except as may be required or permitted by law or authorized by our subscribers.  As a result, information pertaining to particular subscriber(s) or specific actions taken in regard to Abuse complaints may not be disclosed.  However, Covad is committed to identifying alleged offenders and taking all appropriate action to ensure compliance with our Acceptable Use Policy and other Terms of Service.

Sincerely,

The Covad Network Abuse Team
