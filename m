This really begs for numbers. I do not mind the change itself with some
minor comments below.

Do we still need this ifdef? I guess we can wait for an arch which
doesn't like this change and then add the override. I would rather go
simple if possible.

This just hit my eyes. I have to confess I have never seen default: to
be not the last one in the switch. Can we have case 64 instead or does gcc
complain? I would be surprised with the set of BUILD_BUG_ONs.
