People in the armed forces are lazy! Read this article:
 
http://toobis.com/rant-armedforces.html
 
And then forward this to all of your friends so that the world can learn the
truth about our military!! I'm trying to get the word out so people stop
treating these people like royalty when they've hardly done anything for us.
Thank you for your time.
