BSD people are writing tons of articles saying how superior BSD is
respective to Linux.  There is a danger they will impregnate people
with the idea: Linux=second rate system.  The Linux people tend to
know little about BSD so we are at pain to fire back.  And BSD people
tend to "forget" to mention those features Linux had years before BSD
like modules or ELF support.  I would really appreciate info about
features the Linux kernel has and BSDs haven't or about areas where
Linux outperforms BSDs.
