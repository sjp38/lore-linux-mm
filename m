The problem I have faced is that reviewers usually (not generalizing)
review by saying "This is bad",  "This is not acceptable" or "This will
not work" and leaving it there. Instead a reviewer should be focused on
providing the alternates and/or reasons like "This is bad because ..."
or "This will not work. Instead you should be doing ..." In short
towards constructive criticism, providing what reviewers think how it
should be done or resolved to move forward. While providing too much
information may be called spoon-feeding, there is always a balance..
