Hi,

  Now the problem isn't what Stephen wrote, but this damn french
subscriber whose mailsystem decides to send all received messages
back out to the address(es) in the "To:" and "Cc:" headers :-(

The address I killed at VGER's lists is:  eznerald@mnet.fr

I don't know if s/he has subscribed to  linux-mm, but s/he sure
*was* at  linux-kernel ...

  /Matti Aarnio <matti.aarnio@sonera.fi>  ... back to coding (of MTA)
