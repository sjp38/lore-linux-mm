Subject: [PATCH 18/20] dax: Make cache flushing protected by entry lock

Currently, flushing of caches for DAX mappings was ignoring entry lock.
So far this was ok (modulo a bug that a difference in entry lock could
cause cache flushing to be mistakenly skipped) but in the following
patches we will write-protect PTEs on cache flushing and clear dirty
tags. For that we will need more exclusion. So do cache flushing under
an entry lock. This allows us to remove one lock-unlock pair of
mapping->tree_lock as a bonus.
