 Have you seen jamie and chuck talking about madvise() flags ?
 Just doing madvise(cur_stack, MADV_DONTNEED, cur_stack - end_stack)[1]
after a function that uses alloca() or has a large auto should be
a pretty simple addition to gcc (although you might not want to put it
there).

 Those seem like a much better idea to me, as they can also be used in
pthreads (much as I hate pthreads) and other bits of memory that has
similar usage patterns.
 This would also be much more likely to work on other OSes.

[1] I think I have the API correct but I don't have access to it atm.
