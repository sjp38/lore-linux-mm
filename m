Yeah I was also not interested for the longest time because when I 
became concerned when I looked at the code generated by sparsemem for 
virt_to_page and page_address. But that is different now.

Could you keep it around for a while longer? sparse_virtual now allows 
code reduction in page_address and virt_to_page even vs. discontig.
