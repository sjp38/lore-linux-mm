The question wasn't directed at me, but I'd be willing to help, if
people are interested in filling in some gaps in my understanding.

(I may teach a seminar on VM next year, and we may hack on the VM system,
in which case I'll definitely want to write a bunch of stuff down.  I
also want to do some hacking for compressed caching experiments.)

I have some basic questions about the overall design, as well
as a bunch of detailed questions. 

If people are interested in explaining things to me, I'll happily write
up whatever I learn.

(I've been holding off on asking questions because everyone seems to
be madly trying to get 2.2 out.  If this is a bad time, I can ask
my questions later;  if I'm too much of a newbie, I can go read
the sources some more.)
