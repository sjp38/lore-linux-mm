We have seen ramdisk based install systems, where some pages of mapped 
libraries and programs were suddendly zeroed under memory pressure. This 
should not happen, as the ramdisk avoids freeing its pages by keeping them 
dirty all the time.

It turns out that there is a case, where the VM makes a ramdisk page clean, 
without telling the ramdisk driver.
On memory pressure shrink_zone runs and it starts to run shrink_active_list. 
There is a check for buffer_heads_over_limit, and if true, pagevec_strip is 
called. pagevec_strip calls try_to_release_page. If the mapping has no 
releasepage callback, try_to_free_buffers is called. try_to_free_buffers has 
now a special logic for some file systems to make a dirty page clean, if all 
buffers are clean. Thats what happened in our test case.

The solution is to provide a noop-releasepage callback for the ramdisk driver.
This avoids try_to_free_buffers for ramdisk pages. 

To trigger the problem, you have to make buffer_heads_over_limit true, which
means:
- lower max_buffer_heads 
or
- have a system with lots of high memory

Andrew, if there are no objections - please apply. The patch applies against
2.6.23-rc9.
