I just install my Red Hat Linux 5.2. I am using a 486 EISA syster with a 
SCSI adapter AHA-2840VL/2842VL Bios v1.01. There is no network card to my
system. I just have a 56K external modem connected to my serial port #2.

Anyway after my first install, it rebooted and I keep on getting the
following messages:

invalid compressed format (err=2)VFS: Cannot open root device 08:05
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 08:05

Could anyone help this apprentice to resolve this error? Thank you so much
for your time and patience.........

Thankfully yours,

Alex

Apprentice of Red Hat Linux 5.2
