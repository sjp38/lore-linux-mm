Yes, I see.

But we have this problem you see:

--- linux-2.6.0-test2-org/arch/i386/Makefile	2003-07-31 
13:06:52.000000000 -0700
+++ linux/arch/i386/Makefile	2003-08-06 13:09:39.000000000 -0700
@@ -84,6 +84,9 @@
  # default subarch .h files
  mflags-y += -Iinclude/asm-i386/mach-default

+mflags-$(CONFIG_KGDB) += -gdwarf-2
+mflags-$(CONFIG_KGDB_MORE) += $(shell echo $(CONFIG_KGDB_OPTIONS) | 
sed -e 's/"//g')
+

So the -g gets set as well as -gdwarf-2.  And note that the -gdwarf-2 
gets set for asm code also (interesting problem there in that the line 
number info is for the .s file and not the .S and the .s is a tmp file 
to boot).  But back to the -g and kgdb.  I am thinking the thing to do 
is to force DEBUG_INFO off if KGDB is on, thus using what ever we 
finally decide should be after the -g.

Andrew started with -gstabs then -g, then -ggdb which I am sure is the 
same as -gdwarf-2 (the kernel files are exactly the same size with 
either -ggdb or -gdwarf-2) and now, I think, he is back to -g.

I want to use -gdwarf-2 since it a) clearly states what we want, and 
b) the new gdb uses the dwarf2 call frames and thus avoids the "bt" 
confusion caused by gdb not recognizing the function entry sequence 
generated by the newer compilers (I use gcc 3.2.1).  I also expect to 
have dwarf call frames for the asm code some time soon, which will 
allow us to "bt" over interrupt and trap frames.
