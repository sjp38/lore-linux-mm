Greetings,


  My name is L. Willis Rynerson CEO & Founder of "Surfer's Mall" and this is an Invitation for you, your family and your friends to save a lot of money shopping online for you Holiday needs this season.

 This invitation email is a one time offering being sent to you, so you will not be bothered again with this information. I suggest you save this email so that if you don?t find what you're looking for out in the stores you are shopping, you just might find it here. Enjoy your shopping Experience at Surfer's Mall and have an enjoyable season. 


   As you know the Holiday season is upon us again and the thing I keep hearing people talking about, isn't the time of year, it?s the High, Ridiculous Cost of Gasoline!

 This year you will effected more by the cost of fuel/gasoline then at any other time in our Nations history. Having worked in the Transportation Industry for 20 years I know that prices differ all across the country.

 The cost of Diesel fuel, a by-product of making gasoline is going to hit the shopper at every turn this year with everything being prices higher because of hight operating expenses for the transpotation industry. 

What does this have to do with your Holiday Shopping, Everything! Instead of giving your hard earned money to the Oil Industry, try something different this year and see how much you save by, SHOPPING ON LINE from the comfort of your own home or office!        

 That's right Shopping Online at  many great stores and some you don't have in your immediate area. The reason, less travel to and from the stores, which translates into less gasoline being used.

 Now I know that a lot of women out there want to "touch" the things they are considering buying, I understand this, but for toys, for wines, for cheeses, for many other items shopping online can save you a lot of head aches, lots of other expenses you incure while you're out shopping. 

Most of the stores at my Surfer's Mall are offering at this time, Free Shipping or Highly discounted shipping; get all you shopping done by the 20th of December your packages will arrive at their destination in time for the Holiday's. 

Many GREAT DEALS are happening right now, in fact there are too many to list here. The only way you will be able to learn about them is stopping by and shopping or at least widow shopping to compair prices.

Copy and paste the Web Site Address at the bottom of this email into your browser and you will be off on a great shopping experience.


  Thank you for you time and again this is a one time email invitation, so if you don't like the email all you need to do is delete it and you will not be bothered again, but you will miss out on the great savings at Surfer's Mall.
