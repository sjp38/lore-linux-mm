Dear Friend,

I am Mr. Joseph Chau of Investment Banking, Union Bank
Of China. On July 6, 2004, our client Mr. Irvin poot,
a businessman, made a numbered fixed deposit for 6
(six) calendar months, with a value of US$20.5m only
in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to
him and no response came from him. Another
notification was sent early February and still no
response came from him. The Bank officially sent
two-man delegate to his residence in Malaysia were he
reside only to find out that the business mogul and
his family perished in the Tsunami disaster.

After further investigations, it was also discovered
that Mr. Irvin Poot did not declare any next of kin in
his official papers, including the paper work of his
bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time
he visited my office that no one except me knew of his
deposit in my bank. So, Twenty million, Five Hundred
Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my
bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it.

According to the laws of my country, at the expiration
of one year (1 year) the funds will revert to the
ownership of Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to
claim the funds.



I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of
kin to Mr. Irvin Poot to enable you receive the funds.
Lets put heads together to see how we can transfer
these funds out of Hong Kong and use it judiciously.

I have contacted an Attorney that will prepare the
necessary document that will back you up as the next
of kin to Mr. Irvin Poot, all that is require from you
at this stage is for you to provide me with your full
names and Address including your direct phone and fax
numbers for my Attorney to commence his job.

My Attorney will also file in for claims on your
behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of
probate in your favor for the funds to be move to an
account that will be provided by you.

We are going to adopt a legalized method and the
Attorney will prepare all the necessary documents and
no risk involve.

Note that sharing percentage is negotiable by the two
parties. Contact me on this email address
(chaujoshx@primposta.com) with your
full names, address, fax and telephone number
if you are interested and more
details will be provided to you about the Project.

Sincerely,
Chau Joseph.
