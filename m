 I think you want to truncate/lseek after open but before you mmap,
if I'm reading what you want to do properly.
 This is portable (at least it works on Linux/FreeBSD/Solaris).

 The mapping can be synchronized with the file before you munmap() so
I'm not sure what you want mrevert() ? -- I'm positive you're going to
have to do this in user space (Ie. copy the file and then rename() or
don't rename() at munmap() time -- or do a private mapping and write()
to the file at munmap()).

I am always an optimist, but frankly there is no hope.
