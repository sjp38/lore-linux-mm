Hello Marcello,
	I was trying to use vmtrace downloaded from a link given in 
	linux-mm.org.

	The patch given with that package is producing hunks.
	Is there any updated version of this package or any package 
	doing the same job.

	If it is worth updating to the latest git tree,I will give a 
	try.

regards
vibi
