It has been proposed that use of agrinhibiting substances such as AIP
produced by staphylococci belonging to a different agr group might be
beneficial in the treatment of acute staphylococcal infection 5. Such
treatments may decrease the production of extracellular virulence factors
normally upregulated by agr expression.

Several studies included in the overall and subgroup analyses directly
assessed semiempirical combination versus monotherapy  These similarly do
not support combination therapy for specific pathogens when detected
