Hi,

my ISPs smarthost is unreachable (in fact, my whole ISP seems
unreachable at the moment ... good thing my ADSL doesn't need
them for anything) so I'm now sending out email directly.

This means DUL comes into action and I will no longer be able
to send email to jas88 or jknapka.  They can still mail me with
things, but shouldn't expect an answer.

Rik
