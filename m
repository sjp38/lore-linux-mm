A second impression confirms that we have very different ideas of
where to start.  I don't want to be dismissive, and please don't let
me discourage you, but I just don't find what you have very interesting.

I'm sure you'll agree that the interesting part, and the difficult part,
comes with mmap(); and there's no point whatever to THPages without mmap()
(of course, I'm including exec and brk and shm when I say mmap there).

(There may be performance benefits in working with larger page cache
size, which Christoph Lameter explored a few years back, but that's a
different topic: I think 2MB - if I may be x86_64-centric - would not be
the unit of choice for that, unless SSD erase block were to dominate.)

I'm interested to get to the point of prototyping something that does
support mmap() of THPageCache: I'm pretty sure that I'd then soon learn
a lot about my misconceptions, and have to rework for a while (or give
up!); but I don't see much point in posting anything without that.
I don't know if we have 5 or 50 places which "know" that a THPage
must be Anon: some I'll spot in advance, some I sadly won't.

It's not clear to me that the infrastructural changes you make in this
series will be needed or not, if I pursue my approach: some perhaps as
optimizations on top of the poorly performing base that may emerge from
going about it my way.  But for me it's too soon to think about those.

Something I notice that we do agree upon: the radix_tree holding the
4k subpages, at least for now.  When I first started thinking towards
THPageCache, I was fascinated by how we could manage the hugepages in
the radix_tree, cutting out unnecessary levels etc; but after a while
I realized that although there's probably nice scope for cleverness
there (significantly constrained by RCU expectations), it would only
be about optimization.  Let's be simple and stupid about radix_tree
for now, the problems that need to be worked out lie elsewhere.

You are imagining the filesystem putting huge pages into its cache.
Whereas I'm imagining khugepaged looking around at mmaped file areas,
seeing which would benefit from huge pagecache (let's assume offset 0
belongs on hugepage boundary - maybe one day someone will want to tune
some files or parts differently, but that's low priority), migrating 4k
pages over to 2MB page (wouldn't have to be done all in one pass), then
finally slotting in the pmds for that.

But going this way, I expect we'd have to split at page_mkwrite():
we probably don't want a single touch to dirty 2MB at a time,
unless tmpfs or ramfs.

I'm not claiming that the THP refcounting is wrong in what it's doing
at present; but that I suspect we'll want to rework it for THPageCache.

Something I take for granted, I think you do too but I'm not certain:
a file with transparent huge pages in its page cache can also have small
pages in other extents of its page cache; and can be mapped hugely (2MB
extents) into one address space at the same time as individual 4k pages
from those extents are mapped into another (or the same) address space.

One can certainly imagine sacrificing that principle, splitting whenever
there's such a "conflict"; but it then becomes uninteresting to me, too
much like hugetlbfs.  Splitting an anonymous hugepage in all address
spaces that hold it when one of them needs it split, that has been a
pragmatic strategy: it's not a common case for forks to diverge like
that; but files are expected to be more widely shared.

At present THP is using compound pages, with mapcount of tail pages
reused to track their contribution to head page count; but I think we
shall want to be able to use the mapcount, and the count, of TH tail
pages for their original purpose if huge mappings can coexist with tiny.
Not fully thought out, but that's my feeling.

The use of compound pages, in particular the redirection of tail page
count to head page count, was important in hugetlbfs: a get_user_pages
reference on a subpage must prevent the containing hugepage from being
freed, because hugetlbfs has its own separate pool of hugepages to
which freeing returns them.

But for transparent huge pages?  It should not matter so much if the
subpages are freed independently.  So I'd like to devise another glue
to hold them together more loosely (for prototyping I can certainly
pretend we have infinite pageflag and pagefield space if that helps):
I may find in practice that they're forever falling apart, and I run
crying back to compound pages; but at present I'm hoping not.

This mail might suggest that I'm about to start coding: I wish that
were true, but in reality there's always a lot of unrelated things
I have to look at, which dilute my focus.  So if I've said anything
that sparks ideas for you, go with them.
