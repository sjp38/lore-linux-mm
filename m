An encrypted VMA will have KeyID stored in vma->vm_page_prot. This way
we don't need to do anything special to setup encrypted page table
entries and don't need to reserve space for KeyID in a VMA.

This patch changes _PAGE_CHG_MASK to include KeyID bits. Otherwise they
are going to be stripped from vm_page_prot on the first pgprot_modify().

Define PTE_PFN_MASK_MAX similar to PTE_PFN_MASK but based on
__PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT. This way we include whole range of bits
architecturally available for PFN without referencing physical_mask and
mktme_keyid_mask variables.
