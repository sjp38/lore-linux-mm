Yes, it is obvious.

I've spent too many years disciplining myself to develop technology in
response to customer needs and situations, suppressing my instincts to
build neat stuff and trust that they will come.

The part of me that asked that question was expecting every techie
proposal to come with a "Customer Environment Impact Statement."

Meanwhile, in parallel, another part of my mind knew damn well what
you were up to, and was working overtime to make it so.

Yeah, I guess that could be confusing.  Personally I find it amusing.

Brains are weird.

Yup - sure looks that way.  Good job.
