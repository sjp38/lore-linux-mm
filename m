In my on-going attempt to keep them up to date, I've rebased your split
LRU patches [the most recent ones I tested] to 23-rc2-mm1.  I've placed
a tarball of the series at:

http://free.linux.hp.com/~lts/Patches/SplitLru/

No testing since ~22-rc<something>.  Just an ia64 build this am.  I'm
moving office today, so I don't know when I'll have a chance to test.

Later,
Lee
