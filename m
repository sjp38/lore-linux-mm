We are pleased to announce that the Call for Participation [1] for the
2018 USENIX Research in Linux File and Storage Technologies Summit (Linux
FAST Summit '18) [2] is now available.  Linux FAST Summit '18 will take
place at the Oakland Marriott City Center on February 15 and will be
co-located with the 16th USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies
(FAST '18) [3].

Linux is one of the most frequently used platforms in file and storage
research, and FAST is the premier conference for publishing research
results from the file and storage research community.  This summit will
bring together key Linux kernel developers and academic researchers.  The
goal is to provide a forum for presenting and discussing current ideas in
research with a group of active practitioners in the Linux Kernel.

The format will be a single session of short 25-minute talks with
5-minute questions and answers, as well as 45-minute Birds-of-a-Feather
sessions (BoFs).

If you have an idea you'd like to share, or a project in the Linux Kernel
that you'd like to talk about, please send a 400-word summary of the idea
or project and a short description of the benefits that would be achieved
by discussion with kernel practitioners and/or academics to
linuxfast18chairs@usenix.org.  Submissions are due by Friday, January 26,
2018.

We look forward to receiving your submissions!
