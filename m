 The interesting point of Joerg is that he see the TLB mecanism as a
more general mecanism than just to solve swapping problems.

 As I'm a little involved in Distributed Shared Memories (with a PhD ;),
I couldn't let such an opportunity happen without talking. I totally
agree with Joerg. One problems with DSM is that you must track user
memory accesses to maintain coherency. Unfortunatly, fine grain access
like cache line is not available to the average system
programmer. Therefore sub-page protection could be very useful. 

 Regarding DIPC, I think we could improved a little the coherency
protocol. One big advantage of DIPC is that it provide code, and you
can't lie with code. :) I hope I'll have more code in the future to
explain my point of vue in DSM.
