From: Peter Zijlstra <peterz@infradead.org>

With a trace_printk("working\n"); right after the cmpxchg in
task_numa_work() we can see that of a 4 thread process, its always the
same task winning the race and doing the protection change.

This is a problem since the task doing the protection change has a
penalty for taking faults -- it is busy when marking the PTEs. If its
always the same task the ->numa_faults[] get severely skewed.

Avoid this by delaying the task doing the protection change such that
it is unlikely to win the privilege again.
