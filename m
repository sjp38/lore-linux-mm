Dear Sir,


I am Dr Paul Collins, corporate banker in Zenith International Bank of
Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business
proposition for you.
On June 6, 1998, an American Oil Consultant/Contractor with the
Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Robert Noel made a
numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at
US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million US dollars only) in my branch.


Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding
address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and
finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigeria
National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Robert Noel died from an
automobile crash. On further investigation, I found out that he died
without making a "WILL", and all attempt to trace his next of kin was
fruitless.
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Robert
Noel did not declare any kin relations in all his official documents,
including his Bank Deposit paper work in my Bank. This sum of
US$35,000,000.00 only is still in my bank and the interest is being
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one
will ever come foreword to claim it.

According to Nigeria Law, at the
expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership
of the Nigeria Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the
next of kin to Mr. Robert Noel so that the fruit of the old man's
labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government
officials. 

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately
your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the
necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as
the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for
drafting and notarization of the "WILL" and to obtain the necessary
documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the
transfer. 

A Bank account in any part of the world, which you will
provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this of this money to
you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your
account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.
There is no risk at all as the paper work for this transaction will
be done by the Attorney and my position as a senior Manager
guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are
interested, please reply immediately via my private e-mai address
above. 

Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details
and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall
require your assistance to invest my share in your country.


Awaiting your urgent reply by e-mail.


Thanks and regards


Dr. Paul Collins U.
