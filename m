-7. TODO
+7. Soft limits
+
+Soft limits allow for greater sharing of memory. The idea behind soft limits
+is to allow control groups to use as much of the memory as needed, provided
+
+a. There is no memory contention
+b. They do not exceed their hard limit
+
+When the system detects memory contention or low memory control groups
+are pushed back to their soft limits. If the soft limit of each control
+group is very high, they are pushed back as much as possible to make
+sure that one control group does not starve the others of memory.
+
+7.1 Interface
+
+Soft limits can be setup by using the following commands (in this example we
+assume a soft limit of 256 megabytes)
+
+# echo 256M > memory.soft_limit_in_bytes
+
+If we want to change this to 1G, we can at any time use
+
+# echo 1G > memory.soft_limit_in_bytes
+
+NOTE1: Soft limits take effect over a long period of time, since they involve
+       reclaiming memory for balancing between memory cgroups
+NOTE2: It is recommended to set the soft limit always below the hard limit,
+       otherwise the hard limit will take precedence.
+
+8. TODO
 
 1. Add support for accounting huge pages (as a separate controller)
 2. Make per-cgroup scanner reclaim not-shared pages first
