Well, it probably is but using corporate hierarchy to make reviewer shut
up is a problem of that corporation. So if particular examples are brought
to LF TAB attention maybe they could apply some pressure but that's all. In
the end it is a company internal thing. Change your boss / employer if they
do stuff like this to you. E.g. I personally never experienced anything
like this.

Yes, then I think it is up to the maintainer to weight in with his
opinion...
