Google ads - they help pay for bandwidth and new hardware when required ...

... but sometimes they end up showing rather nonsensical ads.

If Microsoft wants to waste their money it's fine by me.  I think

I'd block their ads, but the idea of Microsoft sponsoring a Linux
development site is just too ironic.
