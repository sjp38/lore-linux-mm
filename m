hmmm. 
I'm surprised this report. I didn't know this problem. oh..

Actually, I don't think apache is only file server.
apache is one of killer application in linux. it run on very widely organization.
you think large machine don't run apache? I don't think so.

Yeah, that's ok. I and cristoph have. My worries is my unknown workload become regression.
so, May I assume you run your benchmark both zonre reclaim 0 and 1 and you 
haven't seen regression by non-zone reclaim mode?
if so, it encourage very much to me.

if zone reclaim mode disabling don't have regression, I'll pushing to 
remove default zone reclaim mode completely again.
