Hi everyone,

Just a reminder that if you'd like to attend the LSF/MM summit on
April 1-2, the deadline to apply is February 5th at the end of this
week. See below for more details.

If you did not already do so, please send [LSF/MM TOPIC] suggestions,
or request to [ATTEND], to lsf-pc@lists.linux-foundation.org

Invitations will go out next week: so if you send a TOPIC or ATTEND
mail now, you should expect confirmation next week - numbers
permitting. We shall probably be unable to fulfil late requests to
attend.

Thank you, and hope to see you soon :).
Andrea, Hugh, Mel

Subject: [CFP] Linux Storage, Filesystem & Memory Management Summit 2012 (April 1-2)

The annual Linux Storage, Filesystem and Memory Management Summit for
2012 will be held on the 2 days preceding the Linux Foundation
Collaboration Summit at Hotel Nikko in San Francisco, CA:

	https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/lsfmm-summit
	https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/collaboration-summit/

We'd therefore like to issue a call for agenda proposals that are
suitable for cross-track discussion as well as more technical subjects
for discussion in the breakout sessions.

1) Suggestions for agenda topics should be sent before February 5th
2012 to:

lsf-pc@lists.linux-foundation.org

and optionally cc the Linux list which would be most interested in it:

SCSI: linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org
FS: linux-fsdevel@vger.kernel.org
MM: linux-mm@kvack.org

Please remember to tag your subject with [LSF/MM TOPIC] to make it
easier to track. Agenda topics and attendees will be selected by the
programme committee, but the final agenda will be formed by consensus
of the attendees on the day.

We'll try to cap attendance at around 25-30 per track to facilitate
discussions although the final numbers will depend on the room sizes at
the venue.

2) Requests to attend should be sent to:

lsf-pc@lists.linux-foundation.org

please summarize what expertise you will bring to the meeting, and what
you'd like to discuss.  please also tag your email with [ATTEND] so
there's less chance of it getting lost in the large mail pile.

Presentations are allowed to guide discussion, but are strongly
discouraged.  There will be no recording or audio bridge, however
written minutes will be published as in previous years:

improve this year's, please also send that to:
