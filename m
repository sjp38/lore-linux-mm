The flexibility exists, but wasn't spelled out, so here it is:

1) Similar to madvice(), I envision a cradvice() that could tell the c/r
something about specific resources, e.g.:
 * cradvice(CR_ADV_MEM, ptr, len)  -> don't save that memory, it's scratch
 * cradvice(CR_ADV_SOCK, fd, CR_ADV_SOCK_RESET)  -> reset connection on restart
etc .. (nevermind the exact interface right now)

2) Tasks can ask to be notified (e.g. register a signal) when a checkpoint
or a restart complete successfully. At that time they can do their private
house-keeping if they know better.

3) If restoring some resource is significantly easier in user space (e.g. a
file-descriptor of some special device which user space knows how to
re-initialize), then the restarting task can prepare it ahead of time,
and, call:
  * cradvice(CR_ADV_USERFD, fd, 0)  -> use the fd in place instead of trying
				       to restore it yourself.

Method #3 is what I used in Zap to implement distributed checkpoints, where
it is so much easier to recreate all network connections in user space then
putting that logic into the kernel.

Now, on the other hand, doing the c/r from userland is much less flexible
than in the kernel (e.g. epollfd, futex state and much more) and requires
exposing tremendous amount of in-kernel data to user space. And we all know
than exposing internals is always a one-way ticket :(
