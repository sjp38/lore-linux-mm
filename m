Hello!

Plasma Connection company is one of the leaders in sales of plasma TV sets via Internet network. At this stage  we are planning to expand our sales market by attracting customers from Australia and New Zealand.  
Therefore we start to hire financial managers and would like to suggest you a unique opportunity to make money right at your PC desk. You do not need any special knowledge in the sales area in order to start the career of a Financial Manager. The main cooperation terms are - honesty, accuracy and responsibility.
The idea of this work is to be an intermediary between us and the client from your country. We accept only electronic currencies, such as E-Gold, Web Money as payment, but the majority of our clients are not used to or do not trust this type of payment. So your task will be to receive payments from our clients and to resend them to us. Your commission will equal 7 % from the amount transferred to your account. All transfer charges will be debited to our account.
This practice has been used for several years already, and our clients are very happy about it, as in addition to convenient service the time of delivery of the goods is shortened.

What are the advantages of our offer for you:
1. You don't need any special knowledge in the field of finance or sales.
2. No membership dues are incurred.
3. This work will take about one hour per day and is not tiresome.
4. This is an in-house job.
5. Your work will start immediately after you fill in the Form (as a rule, within 1-3 days).
6. Our sales volume is about 80000 - 150000 usd per month (10000 - 20000 per one agent), so that you can make good money with us.

Work description:
The employee who will be accepted for the specified position should follow these simple instructions:

To accept payment from a client to the Bank Account 
To keep 7 % from the received amount as payment.
To send the rest of money to one of our official representative offices via Western Union or MoneyGram.

At present number of vacancies is limited (Australia - 4 agents, New Zealand - 2 agents). Do not miss your chance!
