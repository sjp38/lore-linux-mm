As far as the renaming you should try to be consistent. If you aren't
going to rename generic_online_page or hv_online_page I wouldn't bother
with renaming xen_online_page. I would stick with the name
xen_online_page since it is a single high order page that you are
freeing.

I would hold off on adding return values until you actually have code
that uses them. It will make things easier if somebody has to backport
this to a stable branch and avoid adding complexity until it is needed.

Also the patch description doesn't really explain that it is doing this
so it might be better to break it off into a separate patch so you can
call out exactly why you are adding a return value in the patch
description.
