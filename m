Dear Friend,   
 
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe =
everyone will die someday. My name is MR. REZA ABDULLA , a merchant in Safat, =
in (Kuwait) I was married with two children. My wife and two children died in =
a car accident six years a go. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. =
It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only =
about a few months to live, according to medical experts.

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for =
anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never =
generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as =
that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know =
that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in =
the world.

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would =
live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has =
called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my =
immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want =
God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms =
to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I =
do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations =
in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so =
badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to =
close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to =
charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the =
money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to =
be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no =
one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Ten Million Seven Hundred Thousand =
American dollars (U.S.$10.700,000) that I have with a finance/Security =
Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and =
dispatched it to charity organizations. I have set aside only 20 % for you =
and for your time and also 5% as miscellaneous expenses. Reply me at your =
earliest convenience for more directives to my private email address: =
rezaabdulla@walla.com 
 
God be with you.

Regards,
Mr. Reza Abdulla
