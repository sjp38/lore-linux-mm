Subject: [PATCH v6 11/13] mm, compaction: skip buddy pages by their order in the migrate scanner

The migration scanner skips PageBuddy pages, but does not consider their order
as checking page_order() is generally unsafe without holding the zone->lock,
and acquiring the lock just for the check wouldn't be a good tradeoff.

Still, this could avoid some iterations over the rest of the buddy page, and
if we are careful, the race window between PageBuddy() check and page_order()
is small, and the worst thing that can happen is that we skip too much and miss
some isolation candidates. This is not that bad, as compaction can already fail
for many other reasons like parallel allocations, and those have much larger
race window.

This patch therefore makes the migration scanner obtain the buddy page order
and use it to skip the whole buddy page, if the order appears to be in the
valid range.

It's important that the page_order() is read only once, so that the value used
in the checks and in the pfn calculation is the same. But in theory the
compiler can replace the local variable by multiple inlines of page_order().
Therefore, the patch introduces page_order_unsafe() that uses ACCESS_ONCE to
prevent this.

Testing with stress-highalloc from mmtests shows a 15% reduction in number of
pages scanned by migration scanner. The reduction is >60% with __GFP_NO_KSWAPD
allocations, along with success rates better by few percent.
This change is also a prerequisite for a later patch which is detecting when
a cc->order block of pages contains non-buddy pages that cannot be isolated,
and the scanner should thus skip to the next block immediately.
