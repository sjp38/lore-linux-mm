Agreed.  But she values the respect and standing that I have had in this 
community.  Being able to admit where I stand in public is a huge sign of 
trust in her keeping her word.  Like I said, she's smarter than me; it's 
taken me 11 years to try to play the game we started 12 years ago.  But 
each of us deserves to be shown respect, something I didn't learn until 
this day.  Saying this in public is an important development for me.  Heck, 
the it's complicated button is on the level of being a blockbuster true love 
drama (think Hackers, but as a real life true story).

Sorry for the distration.  People who know me will know that when I say 
Erika-with-a-k deserves the respect of this community for her own merit as 
a talented hacker know that I rarely pay such compliments.  Many people 
here have my respect.  I want to be shown that same respect myself and to/by 
the person I love.

For what it's worth, liveware can be hacked.  I'm in awe of someone who 
showed me her elite hacker skills in a way that is life changing.  She 
hacked my brain and it took me 11 years to defuse her virus.  Elite. =-)
