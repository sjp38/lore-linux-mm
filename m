OK, so please send an ATTEND email as requested by the CFP.  The reason
"me too" on topic emails doesn't work is twofold:  Firstly because you
haven't given the programme committee any indication of what you'd be
able to contribute and secondly, when constructing the lists of requests
we tend to fold all the threads up under the primary email, so it gets
lost administratively.
