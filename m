My recent enhancements to trinity have turned up a whole bunch of VM bugs
(mostly involving huge-pages), many of which have been there for years
without anyone tripping over them.

I'm interesting in attending LSF/MM summit to get more feedback on other
mm/vfs areas that could use more attention from targetted testing like this.
