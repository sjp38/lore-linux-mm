I wonder how this is going to work with the ACPI device object binding to
memory blocks that's in 3.11-rc.

That stuff will only work if the memory blocks are already there when
acpi_memory_enable_device() runs and that is called from the ACPI namespace
scanning code executed (1) during boot and (2) during hotplug.  So I don't
think you can just create them on the fly at run time as a result of a
sysfs write.

Thanks,
Rafael
