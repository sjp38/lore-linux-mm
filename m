I have tried your arca-vm patches, and must say that this is by far the
best for interactive response. We are making a custom low cost workstation
based on gnome (with only 32m ram) and 2.2.5 with your patch makes it
perfectly usable even with multiple applets and netscape running.
I have seen no strange side effects, even after VERY heavy usage.
Any chance that your VM will be part of a future 2.2 or (eventually) 2.3?
Maybe as a "pluggable" VM?
best regards, and keep up the great work!!

PS: by the way, 2.2.5 compiled with egcs 2.91.66 is perfectly fine...
