Hi Josh, Peter:

Is this something that you already have fixes for?


on x86_64:

drivers/video/fbdev/omap2/omapfb/dss/dispc.o: warning: objtool: dispc_runtime_suspend()+0xbb8: sibling call from callable instruction with modified stack frame
drivers/video/fbdev/omap2/omapfb/dss/dispc.o: warning: objtool: dispc_runtime_resume()+0xcc5: sibling call from callable instruction with modified stack frame



thanks,
