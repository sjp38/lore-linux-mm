Following please find information about one of the BUG() in __free_pages_ok();
I'm re-sending the messages I sent to linux-kernel eariler last week:

-------------

I ran into a BUG in __free_pages_ok which checks:

----------
        if (PageSwapCache(page))
                BUG();
----------

The  call to free the page was from try_to_swap_out():

----------
        /*
         * Is the page already in the swap cache? If so, then
         * we can just drop our reference to it without doing
         * any IO - it's already up-to-date on disk.
         *
         * Return 0, as we didn't actually free any real
         * memory, and we should just continue our scan.
         */
        if (PageSwapCache(page)) {
                entry.val = page->index;
                swap_duplicate(entry);
                set_pte(page_table, swp_entry_to_pte(entry));
drop_pte:
                vma->vm_mm->rss--;
                flush_tlb_page(vma, address);
                __free_page(page);
                goto out_failed;
        }
-----------

The entire trace from kdb is as follows (XXX = unknown):

I have a kdb helper function which prints out some of the fields in the page,
and also below is the hex dump of the "struct page"

----------

---------------------


Question: Is this a problem in the reference count on the page?
If indeed the page can be freed by the call in try_to_swap_out,
then the test in __free_pages_ok will trigger every time this path
is taken. Any one have ideas as to what's wrong?

BTW, the above happened during a relatively normal operation of
using 'diff'. Don't know if it reproducible.
----------------------

As Jeff G. pointed out in another mail, I left out some
important information. If you need more info., please let me know.

(1) this is with kernel version 2.3.99-pre2 with some XFS changes.
(2) I have a 2 CPU X-86 box with 64MB memory.
